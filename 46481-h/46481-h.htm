<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> favour with which, two years ago, my book on <i>The
Partitions of Poland</i> was received by the public has induced
me to devote the interval to a study of the history of another
State which, in modern times, has almost disappeared from
the map of Europe—namely Turkey.</p>

<p>The subject is one in which I have for many years past
taken great interest. In the course of a long life, I have
witnessed the greater part of the events which have resulted
in the loss to that State of all its Christian provinces in
Europe and all its Moslem provinces in Africa, leaving
to it only its capital and a small part of Thrace in Europe,
and its still wide possessions in Asia.</p>

<p>So long ago, also, as in 1855 and 1857, I spent some time
at Constantinople and travelled in Bulgaria and Greece, and
was able to appreciate the effects of Turkish rule. As a
result, I gave a full support, in 1876, to Mr. Gladstone in
his efforts to secure the independence of Bulgaria, and in
1879 was an active member of a committee, presided over
by Lord Rosebery, which had for its object the extension
of the kingdom of Greece so as to include the provinces
inhabited by Greeks still suffering under Turkish rule.</p>

<p>In 1887 and 1890 I again visited the East and travelled
over the same ground as thirty years earlier, and was able
to observe the immense improvements which had been
effected in the provinces that had gained independence,
and how little change had taken place at Constantinople.</p>

<p>In view of these experiences and of the further great
changes portended in Turkey after the conclusion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
present great war, I have thought it may be of use to tell,
in a compact and popular form, the story of the growth and
decay of the Turkish Empire.</p>

<p>History may well be told at many different lengths and
from different points of view. That of the Ottoman Empire,
from the accession of Othman in 1288 to the treaty of
Kainardji in 1774, which secured to Russia a virtual
protectorate in favour of the Christian subjects of Turkey,
has been told at its greatest length by the German professor,
Von Hammer, in eighteen volumes. He is the only historian
who has explored for this long period both Greek and
Turkish annals.</p>

<p>The British historian, Knolles, writing in 1610, told
the story of the growth of the Turkish Empire in two
bulky folio volumes, much admired by two such different
authorities as Dr. Johnson and Lord Byron. The work is
based on a few only of the Greek annals. It is very
discursive and imperfect, but it contains many most terse
and striking passages. Gibbon, the historian of the Roman
Empire, and Sir Edwin Pears, in his most interesting book
on the Destruction of the Greek Empire, have also relied
on Greek authorities up to the capture of Constantinople
by the Turks in 1453, before which date there were no
Turkish historians. Very recently, in 1916, Mr. Herbert
Gibbons, of the Princeton University, published a very
valuable work on the foundations of the Ottoman Empire,
dealing with its first four great Sultans. He has again
examined with very great care the numerous and conflicting
early Greek authorities, and has thrown much new
light on the subject.</p>

<p>Other historians of Turkey, writing in English and
French, such as Creasy, Lane Poole, La Jonquière, and
Halil Ganem (a Young Turk), have drawn their facts
mainly from Von Hammer’s great work. Their books are
all of interest and value. But these writers, and especially
Sir Edward Creasy, in his otherwise admirable <i>History of
the Ottoman Empire</i>, written at the time of the Crimean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
War, to which I have been much indebted, took what
would now be considered too favourable a view of Turkish
rule in modern times, and were over sanguine, as events
have shown, as to the maintenance and regeneration of the
Empire. I have followed their example in basing my
narrative mainly on Von Hammer’s work, correcting it in
some important respects from the other sources I have
named, compressing it into much smaller compass than
they have done, treating it from a somewhat different
point of view, and bringing it down to the commencement
of the present great war in 1914.</p>

<p>It would have been easier to tell the story at double the
length, so as to include much other important and interesting
matter, but, in such a case, the lesson to be drawn from
it would have been obscured by the maze of detail. My
book does not aim at a full history of the long period dealt
with. I have proposed only to explain the process by
which the Turkish Empire was aggregated by its first ten
great Sultans, and has since been, in great part, dismembered
under their twenty-five degenerate successors,
and to assign causes for these two great historic movements.</p>

<p>I will only add that I commenced my recent studies
under the impressions derived in part from some of the
histories to which I have referred and with which I was
familiar, and in part from the common tradition in Western
Europe—dating probably from the time of the Crusaders—that
the Turkish invasions and conquests in Europe were
impelled by religious zeal and fervour and by the desire to
spread Islam. I have ended them with the conviction that
there was no missionary zeal whatever for Islam in the
Turkish armies and their leaders who invaded Europe, and
that their main incentive was the hope of plunder by the sack
of cities, the sale of captives as slaves or for harems, and
the confiscation of land and its distribution among soldiers
as a reward for bravery. I have also concluded that the
decay of the military spirit and the shrinkage of Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
was largely due to the absence of these motives and rewards
when the Turks were on the defensive.</p>

<p>If I have expressed my views freely on this subject, and
on the misrule of the Turks in modern times, I have
endeavoured to state the facts on which they are based with
perfect fairness as between the Crescent and the Cross.</p>

<p>I have purposely refrained from expressing an opinion
as to the future of Turkey, after the conclusion of the existing
great war. The problems which will then have to be
solved are of a different order to those of the past which
have been dealt with in this book. The Turkish Empire,
in the sense of the rule of an alien race over subject races,
has practically ceased to exist in Europe. It survives in
Asia and at its capital, Constantinople, under very different
conditions.</p>

<p>With respect to the numerous works I have consulted
for the latter part of my book, I desire specially to acknowledge
my indebtedness to Mr. Lane Poole’s admirable <i>Life
of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe</i>.</p>

<p>I have to thank Lord Bryce, Lord Fitzmaurice, and Sir
Edwin Pears for their valuable suggestions, and Lady Byles
and Mr. Laurence Chubb for their kind help.</p>

<h2>OTHMAN<br />

<small>1288-1326</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the middle of the thirteenth century a small
band or tribe of nomad Turks migrated from Khorassan,
in Central Asia, into Asia Minor. They were part of a
much larger body, variously estimated at from two to four
thousand horsemen, who, with their families, had fled from
their homes in Khorassan under Solyman Shah. They
had been driven thence by an invading horde of Mongols
from farther east. They hoped to find asylum in Asia
Minor. They crossed into Armenia and spent some years
in the neighbourhood of Erzerum, plundering the natives
there. When the wave of Mongols had spent its force,
they proposed to return to Khorassan. On reaching the
Euphrates River Solyman, when trying, on horseback, to
find a ford, was carried away by the current and drowned.
This was reckoned as a bad omen by many of his followers.
Two of his sons, with a majority of them, either returned
to Central Asia or dispersed on the way there.</p>

<p>Two other sons, Ertoghrul and Dundar, with four hundred
and twenty families, retraced their course, and after spending
some time again near Erzerum, wandered westward into Asia
Minor. They came into a country inhabited by a kindred
race. Successive waves of Turks from the same district in
Central Asia, in the course of the three previous centuries,
had made their way into Asia Minor, and had taken forcible
possession of the greater part of it. They formed there
an Empire, known as that of the Seljukian Turks, with
Konia, the ancient Iconium, as its capital. But this Empire,
by the middle of the thirteenth century, was in a decadent
condition. It was eventually broken up, in part, by assaults
of a fresh swarm of invaders from Central Asia; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
part by internal civil strife, fomented by family disputes of
succession.</p>

<p>When Ertoghrul’s band appeared on the scene, Sultan
Alaeddin ruled at Konia over what remained to him of
the Seljukian State. Other remnants of it survived under
independent Emirs at Karamania, Sarukhan, Mentsche, and
numerous other smaller States. Between them they possessed
nearly the whole of Asia Minor, with the exception of a
few cities in its north-west, such as Brusa, Nicæa, and
Nicomedia and the districts round them, and a belt of
territory along the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmora, and
the Hellespont, to which the Byzantine Emperors, formerly
the owners of nearly the whole of Anatolia, were now
reduced. Two small Christian States also still existed there—Trebizond,
in the north-east, and Little Armenia, in
Cilicia, in the south-east. Though divided among many
independent Emirs, the people of Asia Minor, with
the exception of the Greeks and Armenians, were fairly
welded together. The invading Turks had intermixed with
the native population, imposing on them the Turkish
language, and had themselves adopted the religion of
Islam. Ertoghrul and his nomad tribe, before entering
this country, were not Moslems, but they were not strangers
in language. Whatever their religion, it was held lightly.
They were converted to Islam after a short stay in the
country and, as is often the case with neophytes, became
ardent professors of their new faith.</p>

<p>The oft-told story of the first exploit of Ertoghrul and
his four hundred and twenty horsemen, on coming into the
country of the Seljuks, as handed down by tradition, though
savouring somewhat of a myth, is as follows: They
came unexpectedly upon a battle in which one side was
much pressed. They knew nothing of the combatants.
Ertoghrul spoke to his followers: “Friends, we come
straight on a battle. We carry swords at our side. To
flee like women and resume our journey is not manly.
We must help one of the two. Shall we aid those who
are winning or those who are losing?” Then they said
unto him: “It will be difficult to aid the losers. Our
people are weak in number and the victors are strong!”
Ertoghrul replied: “This is not the speech of bold men.
The manly part is to aid the vanquished.” Thereupon
the whole body of them fell upon the Mongols, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the winning side, and drove them into flight. The side
to which they brought aid and victory proved to be that
of Sultan Alaeddin of Konia. In return for this providential
aid, Sultan Alaeddin made a grant of territory to
Ertoghrul to be held as a fief under the Seljuks. It consisted
of a district at Sugut, about sixty miles south-east of
Brusa, and a part of the mountain range to the west of it.</p>

<p>Ertoghrul and his horsemen were a welcome support to
Alaeddin’s waning fortunes. In a later encounter with a
small Byzantine force they came off victorious, and Alaeddin
made a further addition to their territory on the borders
of his own, over which he had a very nominal sovereignty.
Thenceforth Ertoghrul lived an uneventful pastoral life as
the head of his clan or tribe of Turks in the ceded
territory, till his death in 1288, nearly fifty years from
the date of his leaving Khorassan. His son, Othman, who
was born at Sugut in 1258, was chosen by the clan to
succeed him, and soon commenced a much more ambitious
career than that of his father. When of the age of only
sixteen he had fallen in love with the beautiful daughter
of Sheik Idebali, a holy man of great repute in Karamania.
It is evidence of the small account then held of Ertoghrul
and his son that the Sheik did not think the marriage
good enough for his daughter. It was only after a long
and patient wooing by Othman, and as the result of a
dream, which foretold a great future of empire for his
progeny, that Idebali gave consent to the marriage.</p>

<p>There were no contemporary Turkish histories of the
early Ottoman Sultans. It was not till many years after
the capture of Constantinople in 1453 that Turkish
historians wrote about the birth of their State. They had
to rely upon traditions, which must be accepted with much
reserve. This, however, is certain, that Othman, in his
thirty-eight years of leadership, increased his dominion
from its very narrow limits at Sugut and Eski-Sheir to
a territory extending thence northward to the Bosphorus
and Black Sea, a distance of about a hundred and twenty
miles by an average breadth of sixty miles, an area of
about seven thousand square miles. There are no means
of estimating its population. It was probably sparse, except
on the coast of the Marmora and Black Sea. It included
only one important city, Brusa, which was surrendered by
its garrison and citizens shortly before the death of Othman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
in 1326, after being hemmed in and cut off from communication
with Constantinople for many years. Considerable
as these additions were, the nascent State could
not even yet be considered as important in size. It was
exceeded by several of the larger Turkish Emirates in
Asia Minor, such as Karamania, Sarukhan, and others.</p>

<p>It is notable that Othman, from the outset of his career,
devoted his efforts, not against the Turkish Moslem States
lying to the south and west of him, but against the territory
to the north in possession of the Byzantine Empire, or
which had recently been more or less emancipated from
it, and inhabited chiefly by Christians. It is to be inferred
from this that the motive of Othman was partly a religious
one, to extend Islam. This was not effected by any signal
victories over the armies of the Greek Empire. There
was only one recorded battle against any army of the
Emperor, that at Baphœon, near Nicomedia, where Othman,
who by this time reckoned four thousand horsemen among
his followers, defeated the inconsiderable body of two
thousand Byzantine troops. In the following year, 1302,
the Greek Emperor, Michael Palæologus, alarmed at the
progress of Othman, crossed in person into Asia Minor
at the head of a small army of mercenary Slavs. But
he brought no money with him to pay his soldiers. They
would not fight without pay. They dispersed, and Michael
was obliged to return to his capital. This was his last
attempt to defend his remaining territory in that district.
He was hard pressed in other directions by other Turkish
Emirs in Asia Minor, and in the first decade of the fourteenth
century the Greek Empire lost all its possessions
in the islands of the Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>The extensions of territory by Othman, during his long
reign of thirty-eight years, were effected by a slow process
of attrition, by capturing from time to time petty fortresses
and castles and annexing the districts round them. He
acted in this respect, in the earlier stages, as fief of the
Seljuk State; but later, when that Empire came to an
end, Othman declared his independence, and thenceforth
his accretions of territory were on his own behalf. It
would seem that, as these additions were made, their populations,
or the greater part of them who were Christians,
adopted Islam, not under compulsion—for there is no record
of the massacre of captives or of the sale of them as slaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
—but because they were abandoned by their natural protectors,
the Greeks of Constantinople. The important fact,
clearly shown by Mr. Gibbons in his recent work, is that
the new State thus created by Othman did not consist
purely of Turks. It had a very large mixture of Greeks
and Slavs, who were welded with Turks by the religion
of Islam. They were, from an early period, very distinct
from the people of other Turkish States. They called
themselves Osmanlis. The term ‘Turk’ was used by them
rather as a term of contempt for an inferior people, as
compared with themselves. It was only in later years, when
the other Turkish States of Asia Minor were incorporated
in the Empire, that the term ‘Turk’ was applied to its
people, in the first instance by outsiders, and eventually
by themselves.</p>

<p>To Othman, therefore, is due the credit of this inception
of a new State and a new and distinct people. He did
not, however, assume the title of Sultan. He was simply
an Emir, like so many other rulers of petty States in
Asia Minor. He was not a great general. He had no
opportunity of conducting a great campaign. He was a
brave soldier and a sagacious leader, who inspired confidence
and trust in his followers and subjects. He pursued
with great persistency the policy of enlarging his domain.
He was also a wise and capable administrator, and was
assisted in this by his father-in-law, Idebali, who acted
as his Vizier. He meted out equal justice to all his subjects,
irrespective of race and religion. He was simple and
unostentatious in his habits. There is no record of his
having more than one wife or more than two sons. He did
not amass wealth. He divided the loot of war equally
among his soldiers, setting apart a portion for the poor
and orphans.</p>

<p>Othman had a vein of cruelty in his character, as had
so many of his descendants, the Ottoman Sultans. When,
on one occasion, he propounded to his war council a scheme
of further aggression on his neighbours, his uncle, Dundar,
a nonagenarian, who had been companion in arms to
Ertoghrul, ventured to raise objection to the policy of
further extension. Othman, instead of arguing the question
with him, took up his cross-bow and shot his uncle dead
on the spot, and in this way closured the discussion and
put down, at the outset, opposition in the council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>Von Hammer, in relating this story, says:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This murder of the uncle marks with terror the commencement of
the Ottoman dominion, as the brother’s murder did that of Rome,
only the former rests on better historical evidence. Idris (the Turkish
historian), who, at the beginning of his work, declares that, passing over
in silence all that is reprehensible, he will only hand down to posterity
the glorious deeds of the royal race of Othman, relates, among the
latter, the murder of Dundar. If then such a murderous slaughter of a
relative be reckoned by the panegyrists of the Osmanlis among their
praiseworthy acts, what are we to think of those which cannot be praised
and of which their history therefore is silent?<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We must judge of Othman, however, not by the standard
of the present time, but by that of his contemporaries. By
that standard he was reckoned a humane and merciful
sovereign. This view is expressed in the prayer which
has been used in the religious ceremony, on the accession
of every one of his successors to the throne, when he is
girt with the double-edged sword of the founder of the
Empire, “May he be as good as Othman.”</p>

<p>In his old age, when Othman was incapable of taking
the field himself, his son, Orchan, took his place as the
leader of the army, and just before the death of Othman,
Brusa surrendered to him. It was then, as now, one of
the most important cities in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>When Othman was on his deathbed, after a reign of
thirty-eight years, his son Orchan, in terms of affection
and lamentation, addressed him: “Oh, Othman! Thou
fountain of Emperors, Lord of the World, Thou conqueror
and subduer of Nations.” The dying king replied:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lament not, oh my sons: delight! for this my last conflict is the lot
of all human kind, common to young and old, who equally breathe the
air of this malignant world. Whilst I now pass to immortality, live thou
glorious, prosperous, and happy. Since I have thee for successor, I have
no cause to grieve at my departure. I will give thee my last instructions,
to which be attentive. Bury the cares of life in oblivion. I conjure thee,
crowned with felicity, lean not to tyranny, nor so much as look towards
cruelty. On the contrary, cultivate justice and thereby embellish the earth.
Rejoice my departed soul with a beautiful series of victories, and when
thou art become conqueror of the world, propagate religion by thy arms.
Promote the learned to honour, so the divine law shall be established, and
in what place soever thou hearest a learned man, let honour, magnificence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>and clemency attend him. Glory not in thy armies, nor pride thyself in
thy riches. Keep near thy person the learned in the law, and, as justice is
the support of kingdoms, turn from everything repugnant thereto. The
Divine law is our sole arm, and our progress is only in the paths of the
Lord. Embark not in vain undertakings or fruitless contentions. For it
is not our ambition to enjoy the empire of the world, but the propagation
of the faith was my peculiar desire, which therefore it becomes thee to
accomplish. Study to be impartially gracious to all, and take care to
discharge the public duties of thy office, for a king not distinguished by
goodness belies the name of a king. Let the protection of thy subjects
be thy constant study, so shalt thou find favour and protection from
God.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is probable that much of this was the invention of
some historian, writing many years later. It may be taken,
however, as a summary, based on tradition, of the principles
which had actuated the dying chief during his long
reign.</p>

<p>Othman died shortly after receiving the welcome news
of the surrender of Brusa, and by his last wish was buried
there. He was the progenitor of a royal race who, for nine
more generations, continued the career of conquest which
he inaugurated, till the Empire, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, two hundred and seventy-eight years from
the accession of Othman, under Solyman the Magnificent, the
greatest of his race, reached its zenith. It was only after ten
generations of great Sultans that the race seemed to be
exhausted, and thenceforth, with rare exceptions, produced
none but degenerates down to the present time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2><small>II</small><br />

ORCHAN<br />

<small>1326-59</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Othman</span>, on his deathbed, designated as his successor
the younger of his two sons, Orchan, aged forty-two, who
had been brought up as a soldier under his father’s
eye, and had shown capacity in many campaigns, and
especially in that resulting in the surrender of Brusa.
Alaeddin, the elder brother, was not a soldier. He had
led a studious life, devoted to religion and law, both
founded on the Koran, under the guidance of Idebali.</p>

<p>The Turkish historians agree in stating that Orchan was
most unwilling to act on his father’s wishes and take
precedence over his elder brother, and that he proposed
to divide the heritage of state between them, but that
Alaeddin declined the offer. Orchan is then reported to
have said: “Since, my brother, thou wilt not take the
flocks and herds which I offer thee, be the shepherd of
my people. Be my Vizier.” Alaeddin agreed to this,
and devoted himself to the administration of the growing
State and to the organization of the army, under the rule
of his brother.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>
<p>Orchan followed closely the example of his father. He
pursued the same method of slow, but sure and persistent,
aggrandizement of his State. It will be seen that he succeeded
in adding to it a territory nearly three times greater
than that which he inherited. Two-thirds of this were in the
north-west corner of Asia Minor, along the shore of the
Marmora and the Dardanelles, and the remaining third in
Europe, where he was the first to make a lodgment for the
Ottomans. He made Brusa his capital, and there, after
a time, he assumed the title of Sultan. He coined money
with the inscription, “May God cause to endure the Empire
of Orchan, son of Othman.” The phrase must be taken
rather as a measure of his ambition than as a description
of his existing State, for it was then inferior in size
to several of the Turkish Emirates in Asia Minor and
to most of the Balkan States. Orchan led a most active
and simple life. He was always on the move. When
not in the field with his troops, he spent his time in
visiting his many petty strongholds, seldom remaining more
than a month in any one of them.</p>

<p>The immediate objects of Orchan’s ambition, on his
accession, were the Greek cities of Nicæa and Nicomedia,
with their surrounding districts, the last important possessions
of the Byzantine Empire in Asia. Nicæa was then a
great city. It had attained greater importance during the
sixty years when the Latins were in occupation of Constantinople
and the Greek Emperors were relegated to Asia
and made it their capital. It was well fortified. It could
only be captured, as Brusa had been, by cutting off its
communications with Constantinople, and depriving its
people of the means of subsistence. The Greek Emperor,
Andronicus III, made an effort to relieve it. He hastily
raised an army of mercenaries, in 1326, and led them
across the Bosphorus. He fought a battle against Orchan
at Pelecanon, on the north shore of the Gulf of Nicomedia.
According to the Greek historians, the Ottomans had much
the worst of it, losing a great number of men, while the
losses of the Greeks were trivial. However that may have
been, Andronicus decided on a retreat. But a scrimmage
occurred in the night between his bodyguard and the enemy,
in which the Emperor himself was slightly wounded. He
thereupon fled precipitately, and was conveyed in a litter
to the Bosphorus and thence to Constantinople. His army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
dispirited by this abandonment by their Emperor, was
defeated and dispersed. As a result, Nicæa surrendered
in the following year, 1327, on favourable terms. The
majority of its garrison and citizens followed the example
of those of Brusa and adopted Islam. Very few availed
themselves of the offer to transfer themselves to Europe.
This ill-starred campaign and cowardly flight of Andronicus
was the last effort of the Byzantine Emperors to save
their possessions in Asia. What remained of them, chiefly
the city of Nicomedia, were left to their own resources,
without further aid from Europe. Nicomedia was well
fortified and was apparently a tough job for the Ottomans,
for it held out till 1337, or possibly 1338, and eventually
surrendered in the same way, and on the same terms, as
Brusa and Nicæa.</p>

<p>In the interval of ten years between the capture of
Nicæa and Nicomedia, Orchan was further engaged in extending
his State elsewhere in Asia, not towards Angora,
in the south, as stated by some historians, but to the north-west,
in the ancient Mysia, by the conquest of the Emirate
of Karasi, which lay immediately to the north of Sarukhan
and with a frontage to the sea opposite to the island of
Mytilene. The Emir of this State died in 1333. His
two sons disputed the succession. The younger one was
favoured by the Ottomans, and when he was put to death
by his brother, Orchan sent an army ostensibly to
avenge him. The Emir was driven into exile and his
State was promptly annexed by Orchan. The same fate
befell some other petty Emirates on the southern borders
of the Marmora and the Hellespont, rounding off the
boundary of the Ottoman State in the north-west corner
of Anatolia. The population of Karasi and the smaller
States was mainly Turkish, but there must have been many
Greeks on the coast who probably adopted Islam, as had
the majority of the Greeks of Brusa and Nicæa. After
these acquisitions, and that of Nicomedia in 1338, there
were no further additions to the Ottoman State in Asia
Minor during Orchan’s reign.</p>

<p>There followed, after the capture of Nicomedia, a few
years of peace, and it may well be that, during this time,
Orchan completed the scheme for the organization of his
State and his army. Hitherto, when Othman and Orchan
were involved in disputes with their neighbours, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
was necessary to use armed force in resistance or attack,
an appeal was made for the voluntary service of all the
male members of their petty State or clan capable of bearing
arms; and the appeal was responded to without question.
When the occasion for their service was at an end, the
warriors returned to their homes and to their usual vocations.
With a rapidly expanding territory and with great
ambitions for further conquests, it was evidently thought
necessary to constitute a permanent and well-disciplined
force, and Orchan, whether adopting, or not, the plans of
his brother Alaeddin, determined to effect this. On the
one hand, he enrolled a considerable body of infantry for
continuous service. They were subject to strict discipline
and were well paid, and it will be seen that they could
be sent beyond the realm to assist the Greek Emperor
or otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> On the other hand, a large body of horsemen
was provided, not under continuous service, but under
obligatory service, when occasion arose for calling them out.</p>

<p>For this purpose the country districts were divided into
fiefs, the holders of which were bound to serve in the
event of war, and to come provided with horses and equipment,
or to find substitutes in proportion to the extent of
their fiefs. It was, in fact, the adoption of the feudal
system, then almost universal in Europe, with this marked
difference, that the fiefs were small in extent and were
not, as a rule, hereditary. They were given for life as
rewards for military service, and on the death of their
holders were granted to other soldiers, though in some cases
hereditary claims were recognized. When new territories
were acquired by conquest from non-Moslems, large parts
of them were divided into new fiefs, and were granted to
the soldiers who had distinguished themselves in the war.
Military service, whether in the new infantry or in the
feudal cavalry, was strictly confined to Moslems. Christians,
who were thus exempted from military duty, were subjected
to a heavy capitation tax from which Moslems were free.</p>

<p>This new organization of the army, commenced by
Orchan and extended and perfected by his son Murad,
who also, it will be seen, created the famous corps of
Janissaries, converted the nascent Ottoman State into a
most powerful engine for war, and gave an immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>impetus to the conquest of non-Moslem countries. Most
splendid rewards were held out to the Moslem soldiers for
victory and bravery. In the event of victory they benefited
not only from the ordinary booty in money and chattels,
on the sack of cities and the pillage of country districts.
They also received as their share four-fifths of the proceeds
of the sale of captives as slaves, the other fifth being
reserved as the share of the Sultan. The captives were
not only the enemies’ soldiers taken in battle, but in many
cases the inhabitants of the conquered districts. The strong
and the young of both sexes were carried off and were
sold, the men as slaves, the fairer women for wives or
concubines, or for harems. The soldiers further received, as
has been shown above, a large share of the confiscated lands
to be held as military fiefs in reward for bravery in battle.
As these fiefs were granted for life only, there was a
further distribution among the soldiers of the fiefs held
by their comrades who were killed in battle, and often,
it is said, the same fiefs changed hands many times in
the course of a campaign.</p>

<p>The Moslem inhabitants of a conquered territory were
not sold off as slaves, nor were their lands confiscated.
These measures were reserved for Christians or non-Moslems.
In some cases the Christians were given the
option of embracing Islam in order to avoid slavery and
the confiscation of their land. But these exceptions were
rare in the conquests in Europe, and it is obvious that, to
whatever extent they took place, the rewards obtained by
the soldiers were reduced.</p>

<p>It has been shown that hitherto in the Ottoman conquests
in Asia Minor at the expense of the Byzantine Empire
a great proportion of the Christian population embraced
Islam; and it may well have been that the spread of
Islam and the conversion of infidels to the true faith were
in part the incentives for the expansion of the Ottoman
Empire. But henceforth, after the organization of the army
by Orchan and Murad and the great rewards held out
to the soldiers for the conquest of non-Moslem territories,
it does not appear that the Ottoman armies were inspired
by any missionary zeal for the spread of Islam. The main,
if not the sole motives, were loot and plunder, the sale of
captives as slaves, and the confiscation of land and its
distribution among the soldiers as fiefs; and these objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
were attained to a far greater extent by the invasion of
Christian States in Europe than by the extension of the
Empire over Moslem countries in Asia.</p>

<p>In the year 1354 Orchan, after completing the organization
of his army, turned his attention for the first time to
Europe. Thenceforth, till his death in 1359, his restless
ambition was directed against the Byzantine Empire.
Advancing age prevented his taking the field himself at
the head of his army. But his eldest son, Solyman, who
had all the great qualities of his race, and who was the
idol of the army, took his place in command of the
invading forces.</p>

<p>It may be well to point out here that, at this time,
the middle of the fourteenth century, the Byzantine Empire
was already reduced to very insignificant proportions, compared
to its ancient grandeur. The territories subject to it,
which for centuries had extended to the Danube in Europe,
and in Asia over Anatolia and Syria, had been already
greatly diminished when the leaders of the fourth Crusade,
in 1204, in one of the most disgraceful episodes in
history, turned aside from their avowed object of attacking
the Moslems in Palestine and, in lieu thereof, attacked
and captured Constantinople, and compelled the Byzantine
Emperor to transfer the seat of his government to Nicæa,
in Asia Minor. There followed the brief period of the
Latin Empire. But in 1261 the Byzantine Greeks reconquered
Constantinople, and the ephemeral Latin Empire
disappeared from history. The Byzantines were then able
to recover a small part only of their old dominions in
Europe and Asia. At the time when Orchan, who had
driven them from Asia, decided to attack them in Europe,
they held there no more than Thrace with Adrianople, a
part of Macedonia with Salonika, and the greater part of
the Morea in Greece. To the north of them Serbia, under
Stephen Dushan, the most eminent of its rulers, had asserted
supremacy over the greater half of the Balkan peninsula,
was threatening Salonika, and had ambition to possess himself
of Constantinople. Bulgaria, though it had lost territory
to Serbia, still possessed the smaller half of the Balkans.
The Republics of Venice and Genoa owned many commercial
ports and islands in the Ægean Sea and Adriatic,
and were madly jealous of one another. The position was
such as to afford a favourable opportunity to new invaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
like the Ottomans, for there was no probability of a combination
among these Christian communities to resist them.</p>

<p>The story of the first entry of the Ottomans into Europe,
as told by the early Turkish historians and adopted by
Von Hammer and others, is shortly this. In the year
1356 Solyman, the son of Orchan, at the head of a small
body of Ottoman troops, variously estimated at from
seventy-five to three hundred, under the inspiration of a
dream, stealthily crept, it is said, across the Hellespont in
boats, and succeeded in surprising and overcoming the
Greek garrison of the small fortress of Tzympe, on the
European side of the Straits, and having thus gained possession
of it, increased the invading force to three thousand.
Mr. Gibbons, on the other hand, has unravelled from the
Byzantine historians a much fuller and more reliable story
of the successive entries of Ottoman troops into Europe
from 1345 downwards. It may be briefly epitomized as
follows, in explanation of the great historic event—the first
entry of the Ottomans into Europe—a story which is most
discreditable to the Byzantine Greeks:—</p>

<p>On the death, in 1338, of the Greek Emperor Andronicus
III, the most feeble and incompetent of the long
line of Palæologi, his Grand Chancellor, Cantacuzene, was
appointed, under his will, guardian of his son, John Palæologus,
and as co-regent with his widow, the Empress Anna.
Cantacuzene, not satisfied with this arrangement, and
ambitious to secure supreme power in the Empire, had
himself proclaimed Emperor at Nicotika in 1343. This
was bitterly resented and opposed by the Empress Anna.
Civil war broke out. Both Anna and Cantacuzene appealed
to Orchan, their new and powerful neighbour across the
Straits, for aid against the other. Cantacuzene offered
his young daughter, Theodora, in marriage to Orchan in
return for the aid of six thousand Ottoman troops. Orchan
apparently thought this a better offer than that of the
Empress Anna, whatever that may have been. He was
perhaps flattered by the prospect of a family connection
with a Byzantine Emperor. He closed with the offer and
sent six thousand soldiers into Europe, in 1345, in support
of Cantacuzene, who made use of them by investing Constantinople,
of which the Empress had obtained possession.
After a year’s siege, Cantacuzene effected an entry into
the city by the aid of his partisans there, who treacherously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
opened its gates to him. The Empress was thereupon
compelled to come to terms. She agreed that Cantacuzene
and his wife should be crowned as Emperor and Empress,
together with herself and her son. This union was further
cemented by the marriage of the young Emperor John,
at the age of sixteen, with another daughter of Cantacuzene.
Orchan, in pursuance of his agreement with the new
Emperor, was married in 1346 at the ripe age of sixty-two
to the young Theodora, who was to be allowed to remain
a Christian.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that the six thousand soldiers lent
to Cantacuzene returned to Asia. But the loan of them
soon became a precedent for other transactions of the
same kind. In 1349 the Serbians, under Stephen Dushan,
were seriously threatening Salonika, and had ultimate
designs on Constantinople itself. Orchan was again
appealed to for aid by the two Emperors, his father-in-law
and brother-in-law, and at their instance he sent twenty
thousand soldiers into Europe for the relief of Salonika.
With their aid Cantacuzene was able to defeat the Serbians,
and to extinguish for ever their hope of replacing the
Byzantine Empire at Constantinople. On this occasion,
again, it appears that the Ottoman troops, having effected
their purpose, returned to Asia. But four years later
another opportunity befell Orchan of sending troops across
the Straits, and this time of effecting a permanent lodgment
in Europe. Cantacuzene, not satisfied with being
only a co-Emperor with his son-in-law and the Empress
Anna, attempted, in 1353, to usurp the supreme power in
the State. His son-in-law, John Palæologus, now of full
age, strongly opposed this. Civil war again broke out.
For a third time Cantacuzene appealed to his son-in-law
Orchan for aid. In return for the loan of twenty thousand
soldiers he offered to hand over to the Ottomans a fortress
on the European side of the Hellespont. Orchan agreed
to this. The Ottoman soldiers were sent into Europe,
under Solyman, and were employed by Cantacuzene in
fighting against his other son-in-law, the co-Emperor John.
They were successful in this, and occupied Demotika.
Meanwhile the insignificant fortress of Tzympe was handed
over to Orchan and was occupied by Ottoman troops with
the full consent of Cantacuzene.</p>

<p>Shortly after this an earthquake occurred in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Thracian Chersonese—not an unfrequent event there. It
did great damage to many cities, among others to Gallipoli,
the most important fortress on the European side of the
Hellespont, and at no great distance from Tzympe. Its
walls and ramparts were in great part tumbled down and
destroyed, so that entrance to it was made easy. The
Ottoman troops at the neighbouring Tzympe, under Solyman,
when this opportunity was afforded to them of
getting possession of such an important fortress, determined
to avail themselves of it. The Greek garrison of
Gallipoli, under the belief that the earthquake and the
tumbling down of the walls indicated the Divine will, made
no resistance, and the Ottomans established themselves there
without opposition. Cantacuzene complained of this to
Orchan as a gross breach of their treaty, and demanded
that Gallipoli should be restored to him. He offered also
to pay a fair price for Tzympe. Orchan, though willing
enough to take money for Tzympe, refused point-blank to
give up Gallipoli. “God,” he said, “having manifested
His will in my favour by causing the ramparts to fall,
my troops have taken possession of the city, penetrated
with thanks to Allah.” It will be seen that Greeks and
Turks took the same view of the Divine intervention, the
one to excuse their failure to defend the fortress, the other
to justify their seizure of it.</p>

<p>This action of Orchan roused great indignation at Constantinople.
Cantacuzene now began to see how grave
an error he had committed when inviting the Turks into
Europe. Public opinion compelled him to declare war
against Orchan. He appealed to the Czars of Serbia and
Bulgaria to assist him in driving the Ottomans back to
Asia. They flatly refused to do so. The Czar of Bulgaria
replied: “Three years ago I remonstrated with you for
your unholy alliance with the Turks. Now that the storm
has burst, let the Byzantines weather it. If the Turks come
against me we shall know how to defend ourselves”—a
very unfortunate prediction as events ultimately proved!
The whole course of history might have been altered if
these two Balkan States had joined with the Byzantines in
preventing this lodgment of the Turks in Europe. Want
of union of the Christian Powers was then, as on many
other later occasions, mainly responsible for the extension
of the Ottoman Empire in that continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>Cantacuzene was soon to reap the just reward for his
treachery to his country. So far everything had gone
well with him. He had ousted the Palæologi from the
throne, of which, it must be admitted, they were quite
unworthy. He had proclaimed his son Matthew as co-Emperor
with himself. But when the full effect of his
policy of inviting the Turks into Europe was understood
there was a revulsion of feeling against him at
Constantinople. The Greek Patriarch refused to crown
Matthew. A revolution took place in the city. Cantacuzene
found himself without friends. He was everywhere accused
of having betrayed the Empire to the Turks. He was
compelled to abdicate. He became a monk and retired
to a monastery in Greece. He spent the remaining thirty
years of his life in seclusion there, and in writing a history
of his times, which, though very unreliable, tells enough
of his own misdeeds to justify the conclusion that, by
inviting the Ottomans into Europe, he proved to be a
traitor to his country. The Empress Irene, his wife,
became a nun.</p>

<p>John Palæologus was recalled by the people of Constantinople,
and, after defeating Matthew, not without
difficulty, was established there as sole Emperor. His
reign lasted for fifty years, a period full of misfortune
for the Empire. He was no more able to compel or
induce the Turks to evacuate Europe and return to
Asia than his father-in-law. The twenty thousand soldiers
who had been invited to Europe by Cantacuzene remained
there as enemies of the State they had come to assist.
Under the command of Solyman, they advanced into
Thrace and captured Tchorlu, within a few miles of Constantinople.
Though the occupation of this city and of
Demotika was only temporary, the Ottomans firmly established
themselves in the southern part of Thrace. The
Emperor John was eventually compelled to sign a treaty
with Orchan, which recognized these Ottoman conquests
in Thrace. Thenceforth the Byzantine Empire became subservient
to, and almost the vassal of, the Ottoman Sultan.
Solyman brought over from Asia many colonies of Turks
and settled them in the Thracian Chersonese and other parts
of Thrace.</p>

<p>In 1358 Solyman, who had shown great capacity when
in command of the Ottoman army, met with his death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
by a fall from his horse when engaged in his favourite
sport of falconry. His father, Orchan, died in the following
year at the age of seventy-two. He had enormously
increased the Ottoman dominions. He had achieved the
first great object of his ambition, that of driving the
Byzantines from their remaining possessions in Asia. He
had rounded off his boundaries in the north-west corner
of Anatolia by annexing Mysia. He had invaded Europe
and had extended Ottoman rule over a part of Thrace.
He had reduced the Byzantine Emperor almost to vassalage.
These great results had been achieved not so much by
force of arms as a general, for he is not credited with
any great victory in the field, or by successful assaults
on any great fortresses, as by crafty diplomacy and
intrigue, backed up by superior force, and by taking
advantage of the feebleness and treachery of the Byzantines.
He also forged the military weapon by which
his son, Murad, was able to effect far greater territorial
conquests, both in Europe and Asia.</p>

<h2><small>III</small><br />

MURAD I<br />

<small>1359-89</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Murad</span> succeeded his father, Orchan, at the age of forty.
He soon proved himself to be eminently qualified to rule
by his untiring activity and vigour, his genius for war,
and his wise and sane statesmanship. He was illiterate.
He could not even sign his name. There is extant in
the archives of the city of Ragusa a treaty with its petty
republic, which Murad, in 1363, signed by dipping his
hand in ink and impressing it with his finger marks.
The ‘tughra’ thus formed became the official signature
of subsequent Sultans of Turkey. Osman and Orchan
between them created the Ottoman dynasty and State,
but Murad must be credited with having founded the
Empire in the sense of imposing Ottoman rule on subject
races.</p>

<p>On Murad’s accession his territory, though greatly increased
by Orchan, was less in extent than some other
Turkish Emirates in Anatolia. It consisted of an area
on both sides of the Sea of Marmora, two hundred miles
in length by about one hundred in depth. It included
both shores of the Dardanelles, but only one side of the
Bosphorus. Constantinople, on the other side, though
nearly hemmed in by the Ottomans, was nominally independent,
and its communications with the Greek province
of Thrace were still open. Deducting the area of the
Sea of Marmora, the territory under Murad’s rule was not
of greater area than twenty thousand square miles. Its
population probably did not amount to a million in
number. It is difficult to understand how Murad from
this small territory so enormously increased his Empire
in Europe. It may be surmised that large numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Turks from other parts of Anatolia flocked to his standard
in search of adventure and booty in Europe.</p>

<p>The ownership of both sides of the Dardanelles did
not, in the days before the invention of gunpowder, give command
of the Straits, and as Murad was without a navy,
the passage of his armies between Asia and Europe was
at the mercy of any naval Power. The Genoese, who
had important commercial settlements on the shores of
the Black Sea and on the Bosphorus at Galata, and who
maintained a large naval force in the Ægean Sea, might
easily have barred the way of the Ottomans to Europe,
but they hated the Greeks and were greedy of money,
and they could be relied on to convey Murad’s armies
across the Straits for a full consideration. It will be seen
that Murad, during his reign of thirty years, increased
by more than fivefold the Ottoman possessions, and at
one point brought them up to the Danube. He compelled
other States also, including the Greek Empire itself, to
accept the position of tributaries to his Empire. His fame
in Ottoman history must be regarded as on a level with
that of Mahomet, the Conqueror of Constantinople, and
of Solyman the Magnificent, who raised the Empire to
its zenith.</p>

<p>Murad’s great extensions of his Empire may more conveniently,
than in a chronological order, be treated under
three distinct heads:—</p>

<p>1. His conquest of the possessions of the Greek Empire
in Thrace and Bulgaria and the reduction of that decadent
Empire to the humiliating position of vassalage.
2. His great conquests in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Serbia.
3. His extensions in Anatolia by the absorption of Turkish
Emirates or parts of them.</p>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Conquests in Thrace.</span></h3>

<p>The Greek Empire, under John Palæologus V, the most
unfortunate and incompetent of men, on the accession of
Murad, was in a perilous and decadent condition. We
have already shown how small were its remaining possessions
in Europe. It had no friends on whom it could rely
to stem the advance of the Moslems. The old spirit of
the early Crusaders in Europe was almost extinct. There
was a bitter feud between the Latin and Greek Churches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
They hated one another more than they feared the Turks.
It was a condition of any assistance of the Latin Christians
that the Greeks should come into the fold of the Pope
of Rome. The Greeks, on their part, flatly refused this,
even for the purpose of saving their Empire from extinction
by the Moslem Turks.</p>

<p>It was under these conditions that Murad, in the first
year of his reign, determined to follow up the designs of
his father by conquests in Europe. Leaving Brusa, the
then capital of his State, he crossed the Dardanelles, and
at the head of a great army marched into Thrace. His
generals, Evrenos and Lalashahin, commanded the two wings
of it. Evrenos advanced on the left, recaptured the fortress
of Tchorlu, five miles from Constantinople, massacred its
garrison, and razed its walls. Lalashahin, on the right,
captured Kirk Kilisse, and thus protected the army from
a possible landing of the enemy from the Black Sea.
Murad then advanced with the centre of his army, formed
a junction with the two wings, and fought a great battle
at Eski Baba, in 1363, in which he completely defeated
the Byzantine army opposed to him, with the result that
Adrianople surrendered without a struggle and almost the
whole of Thrace fell into Murad’s hands. Lalashahin then
advanced up the Maritza Valley into Bulgaria and captured
Philippopolis, a Byzantine possession south of the Balkans.</p>

<p>As a result of this successful invasion the Greek Emperor
found himself compelled to enter into a treaty with Murad,
by which he bound himself to refrain from any attempt
to recover what he had lost in Thrace, to abstain from
giving aid to the Serbians and Bulgarians in resisting a
further advance of the Ottomans in Europe, and to support
Murad against his Anatolian enemies, the Turkish Emirs.
Murad thereupon returned to Brusa to cogitate over new
enterprises and to organize his forces. He was soon recalled
to Europe by most serious events. The Christian
Powers had shown no disposition to help the Greeks against
the Ottoman invasion, while their possessions in Asia and
Europe were being invaded, but the advance into Bulgaria
seems to have caused alarm to them. Pope Urban V
stirred up Louis, the King of Hungary, and the Princes
of Serbia, Bosnia, and Wallachia to resist. They combined
together and sent an army of twenty thousand men into
Thrace, with the avowed object of driving the Turks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
out of Europe. Murad hastened to confront them, but
before he could arrive on the scene of action his general,
Lalashahin, led an army against the allies. The two armies
met on the River Maritza, not far from Adrianople, in
1363. Ilbeki, in command of the Ottomans, made a sudden
night attack, when the Christian troops were heavy with
sleep after a festive revel. A stampede took place. The
Turkish historian says of the allied army: “They were
caught even as wild beasts in their lair. They were driven
as flames are driven before the wind, till, plunging into the
Maritza, they perished in its waters.”</p>

<p>The Christian army was practically exterminated. The
King of Hungary escaped by a miracle. It was the first
conflict of the Ottomans with the Hungarians, who were
destined to bar the way into Europe for a hundred and
fifty years. As a result of this battle all the country south
of the Balkan Mountains was incorporated in the Ottoman
Empire. Ilbeki, who devised the night attack, and so
successfully carried it out, was made away with by poison,
at the instance of Lalashahin, who was madly jealous of
his great victory.</p>

<p>The battle of the Maritza was a crushing blow to the
Christians. One result of it was that Murad decided in
favour of a scheme of conquest in Europe rather than
in Asia. In this view he transferred the seat of his government
from Brusa to Thrace, and made Demotika the capital
of his Empire. Three years later he transferred it to
Adrianople, which for ninety years, till after the capture
of Constantinople, held this position, and from thence he
organized his great invasion of the Balkan States. Another
result was that the Greek Emperor, John Palæologus V, was
forced into a further step towards subjection to the
Ottomans. He agreed to become a tributary to the Sultan
and to send a contingent to the Ottoman army in
future wars.</p>

<p>After a time the Emperor fretted under this position of
vassalage, and in 1369 he went on a mission to Rome, in
the hope of inducing the Pope to stir up the Christian
Powers of Europe to another crusade against the Ottomans.
He left his eldest son, Andronicus, in charge of the government
at Constantinople during his absence. Arriving at
Rome, he submitted to the most humiliating conditions with
the object of gaining the support of the Pope Urban V. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
abjured at St. Peter’s, before the High Altar, the principles
of the Greek Church, so far as they differed from
those of Rome. He admitted the ecclesiastical supremacy
of the Pope. He was then permitted to bend his knee,
and to kiss the Pope’s feet and hands. He was privileged
also to lead the Pope’s mule by the bridle. He obtained,
however, no return for these abject humiliations. The
Pope was unable to induce the Christian Powers again to
take up arms against the Ottomans.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s concessions to the Pope were also disavowed
by the Hierarchs of the Greek Church at Constantinople.
There never was any prospect of a reunion
of the two Churches. The Emperor, John Palæologus,
embarked on his homeward journey having nothing to show
for his pains. On his way back, when passing through
Venice, he was arrested, at the instance of his Venetian
creditors, who had lent him money to defray the cost of
his mission. Not having the means to pay, he could not
discharge the legal process. Andronicus had no wish that
his father should ever return to Constantinople. He made
no effort to raise money for the release of the Emperor.
He pleaded the poverty of the Treasury. A younger son,
Manuel, however, with more filial piety, raised the necessary
sum, by selling all his property, and obtained the
release of his father. Shortly after his return to Constantinople
the Emperor, as was to be expected, deprived
Andronicus of all his appointments, and replaced him
by Manuel, whom he also made co-Emperor with
himself.</p>

<p>The son of Andronicus, of the same name, furious at
this treatment of his father, entered into a mad conspiracy
with Saoudji, the youngest son of Sultan Murad, with the
object of dethroning both Emperor and Sultan and reigning
in their place. Saoudji, being in command of the Sultan’s
army in Europe, during the absence of Murad in Asia, was
able to tamper with the loyalty of the Ottoman troops.
He assembled a considerable force in the neighbourhood
of Constantinople, where he was joined by a
large number of the sons of Greek nobles and by many
soldiers.</p>

<p>Murad, when he heard, at Brusa, of this mad outbreak,
returned with all haste to Europe, and organized resistance
to it, in concert with the Greek Emperor. They agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
that the two rebels, when captured, should be deprived
of their eyesight. Murad thereupon, taking what soldiers
he could get together, marched to meet Saoudji’s army.
When within hearing of it, he called out to the soldiers
by night, urging them to return to their duty and promising
pardon to them. The soldiers, hearing the voice of the
Sultan, who had so often led them to victory, repented
of their treachery and deserted the cause which they had
so foolishly taken up. Saoudji and Andronicus and the
band of Greek nobles, thus deserted by the rank and file
of the army, took refuge in the fortress of Demotika.
Murad had no difficulty in capturing this place, and with
it the two rebel princes and the Greek nobles. In
pursuance of his agreement with the Emperor, he then
deprived his own son of his eyesight and, going beyond
his promise, had the young man executed. He caused
the Greek nobles to be bound, two and three together,
and thrown into the Maritza, while he stood on the bank
and revelled in the sight of their drowning struggles. In
some cases he insisted on parents themselves putting
their sons to death in his presence. When they refused,
the parents were drowned in the river together with their
sons. In this instance Murad showed that he had in him
the vein of cruelty which was conspicuous, more or less,
in all the descendants of Othman. Andronicus was handed
over to the Greek Emperor, who partially, but not completely,
carried out his promise of depriving his grandson
of eyesight.</p>

<p>As a result of these events, the Emperor John
Palæologus found himself compelled to enter into another
treaty with Murad, by which, in order “that he might
enjoy up to the end of his life in peace his last possession,”
he recognized himself as vassal of the Sultan,
promised to do military service in the Ottoman army,
and gave his son Manuel in charge of Murad as a hostage.</p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Conquests in Macedonia, Bulgaria, and
Serbia.</span></h3>

<p>The conquest of Thrace by the Ottomans and the defeat
of the allied Christians at the Maritza were as great blows
to the Bulgarians as to the Greek Empire, though they
had given no assistance to the allies. The occupation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Adrianople and Philippopolis opened the way to a further
advance into Bulgaria and Macedonia. It was not, however,
till 1366 that Murad availed himself of this advantage,
and commenced the series of attacks which ultimately made
him master of Macedonia and of a great part of Bulgaria
and Serbia. The position of affairs in the peninsula at this
time was very favourable to him. The Bulgarians, Serbians,
Bosnians, and Greeks were madly jealous of one another;
each of them preferred the extension of the Ottoman rule
to that of their rivals. Bulgaria alone, if united, might
have successfully resisted Murad. But in 1365 its Czar,
Alexander, died, and his kingdom was divided between
his three sons. Sisman, the elder, got the largest share.
The other two gave no assistance to their brother
when the Ottomans invaded his country. Between 1366
and 1369, Murad advanced into Bulgaria, and took possession
of the Maritza Valley, as far as the Rhodope Mountains.
In 1371 Lalashahin encountered an army of Bulgarians
and Serbians at Samakof, not far from the city of Sofia,
and completely defeated it, with the result that Bulgaria,
up to the Balkan range, was annexed to the Ottoman
Empire. It remained so for over five hundred years, till
its release in our own times.</p>

<p>After this great victory at Samakof, Lalashahin was
instructed by Murad not to pursue his conquest of Bulgaria
north of the Balkan range, but to proceed westward, and, in
concert with Evrenos, to invade Macedonia as far as the
River Vardar. This occupied the two generals in the years
1371-2. Kavalla, Druma, and Serres fell into their hands.
In 1372 they crossed the Vardar River and penetrated
into Old Serbia, Albania, and Bosnia. The main part
of Serbia, however, remained in the hands of Lazar,
its prince. But he was compelled to acknowledge the
suzerainty of the Sultan. As regards the part of Bulgaria
not annexed, its prince, Sisman, was allowed to retain his
independence. His daughter entered the harem of Murad,
with the understanding that she was not to be compelled
to adopt the Moslem religion. It was not till 1381 that
a further advance was made by Murad. He then sent his
armies across the Vardar River and captured Monastir. He
also took possession of Sofia, and in 1386 of Nisch, after a
fierce struggle with the Serbians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Murad’s Acquisitions in Asia Minor.</span></h3>

<p>Between the years 1376 and 1380 Murad found himself
able to turn his attention in the direction of Asia Minor.
In the first of these years he induced the Emir of Kermia,
doubtless by threats of war, to give a daughter in marriage
to Bayezid, his eldest son. She brought with her as dowry
a considerable part of Kermia and the fortress of Kutayia,
a position of great strategic importance. In 1377 he
followed this up by inducing the Emir of Hamid to sell
a great portion of his Emirate lying between Tekke, Kermia,
and Karamania, including the district of Ak-Sheir. The
effect of this acquisition was to make his frontier conterminous
with that of Karamania. Again, in 1378, he
declared war against the Emir of Tekke, and annexed
a part of his territory, leaving to him Adalia.</p>

<p>Murad made no further effort to extend his dominion in
Asia till 1387, when he led a large army against Alaeddin,
the Emir of Karamania. For this purpose he called upon
the Greek Emperor and the Princes of Serbia and Bulgaria
as vassals of the Empire to send their contingents. His
two sons, Bayezid and Yacoub, commanded the wings of
this army. With a view to conciliate the peasantry of
the district he passed through, and to ensure full supplies
of food to his army, he gave strict orders that there
was to be no pillage, and that the lives and property of
the country people were to be respected. Among his troops
were two thousand Serbians, whom the Prince of Serbia
was bound by his recent treaty to supply. These men
refused to obey Murad’s order, and committed atrocious
depredations on the route of the army. Murad inflicted
severe punishment on them, and directed many of them
to be put to death as a warning to the others. The army
then marched to meet the Karamanians. A battle again
took place on the plain of Angora. Bayezid especially
distinguished himself by the fierceness of his cavalry
charges and earned for himself the sobriquet of ‘the
Thunderbolt.’</p>

<p>There are different versions as to the issue of this battle.
Some historians describe it as a great victory for Murad,
and claim that he treated the vanquished Emir of Karamania
with great generosity, insisting only on a token of
submission. Murad, however, was not in the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
neglecting to take full advantage of any successes of his
armies. It is very certain that, in this case, he did not
succeed in extending his Empire. Karamania retained its
independence for many years to come, and did not even
submit to a nominal vassalage. It seems more probable,
therefore, that this battle was indecisive, and that Murad
withdrew, without having effected his purpose.</p>

<p>Murad, who was now near the age of seventy, would
have been glad to end his life in repose, but he was
recalled to Europe by an outbreak of the Serbians. It
appeared that the Serbian soldiers, on their return to their
homes, after the campaign against the Karamanians, told
the story of the execution of their comrades by order of
Murad. It caused universal indignation among the
Serbians. They could not understand a war conducted
without the levy of booty from the enemy’s country.
The whole of Serbia rose in rebellion. An alliance was
formed with Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Albania. Assistance
was obtained from Hungary and Wallachia. Murad again
took the field in command of an Ottoman army, and,
crossing the Balkans, captured Schumla and Tirnova, and
then marched towards the Danube. Sisman, the King of
Bulgaria, shut himself up in Nicopolis, on the Danube,
but was soon compelled to come to terms. He agreed
to give up Silistria to the Turks, and to pay a tribute in
the future.</p>

<p>Lazar, the King of Serbia, in spite of this defection,
continued the struggle against the Ottomans, and Sisman
himself broke the treaty almost before the ink was dry.
He refused to give up Silistria, and sent a contingent in
aid of the Serbians. Murad sent part of his army, under
Ali Pasha, against Sisman, who was again shut up in
Nicopolis. This fortress was captured. Murad was again
generous in sparing Sisman’s life, but this time he deprived
the southern part of Bulgaria of its autonomy, and
insisted on its being completely incorporated in the
Turkish Empire.</p>

<p>Lazar, the King of Serbia, continued the war. Murad,
in spite of his seventy years, led his army, supported,
as in Asia Minor, by his two sons. The decisive battle
took place on the plain of Kossova, at the point of junction
between Serbia and Bulgaria. It was fiercely contested.
At a critical point of it a Serbian noble, Milosch Kobilo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>witch,
who on the previous day had been falsely charged
in the Serbian camp with disaffection and treason, gave
signal proof of his patriotism by riding boldly into the
Turkish lines, as though he was a deserter, and claiming
that he had a most important message to deliver to the
Sultan. He was allowed to approach Murad, and, while
kneeling before him, plunged a dagger into his heart,
causing a mortal wound. Milosch then made a desperate
rush to escape, but in vain. He was captured and brought
to the Sultan’s tent. Meanwhile Murad, in spite of his
approaching death, was able to give orders for the charge of
his reserves, which decided the battle in favour of the
Ottomans. The Serbians and their allies were completely
defeated and routed. Lazar was taken prisoner and was
brought to the Sultan’s tent. Murad lived long enough
to direct the execution in his presence of Lazar and
Milosch. He then expired.</p>

<p>To complete the tragedy of the day, Bayezid, on hearing
of the death of his father, and his own consequent accession
to the throne, gave immediate orders for the murder
of his brother Yacoub, who had been his valiant companion
in arms in so many battles. This was effected in
the presence of the dead body of the father. The brutal
deed was justified by a verse from the Koran, “Rebellion
is worse than execution.” It was assumed by Bayezid
that his brother would claim the throne against him. This
was the first recorded case of fratricide in the Othman
royal race. Thenceforth it became the settled practice for
a Sultan of Turkey, on his accession to the throne, immediately
to put to death his brothers and other collaterals, lest
they should dispute the succession with him. By the law
of succession the eldest living male of the reigning family,
and not the eldest son of a defunct Sultan, was entitled
to the throne. This supplied an additional motive for
the practice of fratricide, for the new Sultan, by murdering
his brothers and uncles, ensured the succession, after his
own death, to his eldest son free from competition. In
later times, however, when public opinion would no longer
justify fratricide, and when the law of succession of the
oldest male in the family was more fully recognized, the
Sultan, on his accession to the throne, directed the close
confinement of his next heir, generally his brother. It
followed from this practice that the heir to the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
instead of being employed on State affairs, or as a general,
and gaining experience, was treated as a prisoner, and was
forbidden to take any part in public affairs. It will be
seen that this practice of forced seclusion of the heir to the
throne during the lifetime of the reigning Sultan was one
of the main causes of the degeneracy of the Othman
dynasty.</p>

<p>Reverting to Murad, it has been shown how important
an epoch his reign was in the growth of the Ottoman
Empire. During the twenty-four years of war, in which
he led his armies in the field, he never met with
a reverse. He extended the Empire for the first time
into vast territories inhabited not by Turks or by
Byzantines, but by sturdy Christian races, such as the Bulgarians,
Serbians, and Bosnians. For the first time also
the Turks came into conflict with the Hungarians, and
defeated them. The influence of the Empire was extended
practically to the Danube. Some of the intervening territory
was not treated as conquered country and added
to the Empire, but was allowed to retain the position
of tributary or vassal States, as in the case of Serbia.
Other parts, such as Thrace, Macedonia, and Bulgaria,
were fully incorporated in the dominion of the Sultan.</p>

<p>Murad, when not engaged in war, devoted himself to
perfecting the organization of his army on the lines laid
down by his father, Orchan. He also created a new
standing corps of soldiers, recruited from the Christian
population of the provinces conquered in Europe. This
was the renowned corps of Janissaries—the new army. Von
Hammer and other historians following him, and more
recently Sir Edwin Pears, give very full details as to the
constitution of this corps and the motives of its founder.
They state that one thousand lads, between the ages of ten
and twelve, were in every year conscripted from amongst the
children of Christian parents. The most physically strong
and intelligent of them were taken. They were forcibly
converted to Islam, and were trained with great care for
military careers under the immediate direction of the Sultan.
After six years of training they were drafted into a special
corps, which reached, after a few years, a maximum of
twelve thousand men. The discipline of this corps was very
severe. It formed the most efficient and reliable body
in the Ottoman army. The men looked on their regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
as their home. Their lives were devoted to it. They
were not allowed to own property. What they acquired
belonged to the regiment. They were not, till a later
period in the history of the Empire, allowed to marry.
They formed the backbone of the Ottoman armies in war;
and in many a hard-fought battle, when disaster and defeat
were imminent, they saved the army by their intrepid and
persistent stand against the enemy. The object which
Murad aimed at is said to have been not merely the
strengthening of his army by a standing force of this
kind, but that it should, by its personal devotion to the
Sultan, act as a check on his other turbulent forces.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Sir Edwin Pears says of this force:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Take a number of children from the most intelligent portion of the
community; choose them for their strength and intelligence; instruct them
carefully in the art of fighting; bring them up under strict military
discipline; teach them to forget their childhood, their parents, and
friends; saturate them with the knowledge that all their hope in life
depends upon their position in the regiment; make peace irksome and
war a delight, with the hope of promotion and relaxation from the
hardship and restraints of the barracks; the result will be a weapon in
the hands of a leader such as the world has rarely seen. Such a weapon
was the army of the Janissaries.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The levy of children was regarded by the Christians as
a blood tax of a terrible kind. The corps thus formed
was a most valuable instrument in the hands of Sultans who
were strong enough to control it. But later, in the times
of degenerate Sultans, it became a kind of Prætorian
Guard. It dictated the deposition of Sultans and the
nomination of their successors. It often insisted on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>policy of war. In 1648, under Mahomet IV, the restriction
of the force to Christian children was removed, and
the sons of Janissaries and other Moslems were admitted.
Later the levy of Christian children was abandoned, and
none but sons of Moslems were admitted to the corps.
After the time of Solyman its numbers were greatly increased.
It became a danger to the State. It will be
seen that in 1826 Mahmoud II took vengeance on it for
the humiliations he and previous Sultans had undergone,
and extinguished it in ruthless scenes of blood.</p>

<p>There cannot be a doubt, however, that Murad, by
creating this corps of Janissaries and recruiting it from
the Christian population in Europe, forged a weapon which
for two hundred years to come played a dominant part
in the aggrandizement of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Knolles, in his graphic history of the Turkish Empire,
sums up the character of Murad in the following sentences,
which could not be improved upon:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Murad was more zealous than any other of the Turkish kings; a man of
great courage and in all his attempts fortunate; he made greater slaughter
of his enemies than both his father and grandfather; his kingdom in
Asia he greatly enlarged by the sword, marriage, and purchase; and using
the discord and cowardice of the Grecian princes to his profit, subdued a
great part of Thracia, with the territories adjoining thereto, leaving unto
the Emperor of Constantinople little or nothing more in Thracia than the
imperial city itself, with the bare name of an emperor almost without an
empire; he won a great part of Bulgaria and entered into Serbia, Bosnia,
and Macedonia; he was liberal and withal severe; of his subjects both
beloved and feared; a man of very few words, and one that could
dissemble deeply.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p></blockquote>

<h2><small>IV</small><br /><br />

BAYEZID I<br />

<small>1389-1403</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bayezid</span> succeeded his father, Murad, at the age of thirty-four.
He reigned as Sultan for only fourteen years, the
last of which was spent in captivity. No one of the Othman
race passed through such vicissitudes, with such a brilliant
career of victory during nearly the whole of his reign, but
ending with overwhelming and crushing defeat. He had
all the courage and military capacity of his three predecessors.
He excelled them greatly in cruelty and brutality.
In his private life he descended to depths of sensuality
and unmentionable and degrading vice which were unknown
to them.</p>

<p>Early in his reign he adopted a much bolder attitude
toward the Christian Powers of Europe than Murad had
thought prudent. To a deputation from Italy asking for a
renewal of commercial privileges, he replied that when he
had conquered Hungary he intended to ride to Rome, and
there give feed to his horse with oats on the altar of St.
Peter’s. His treatment of his Christian subjects was much
harsher than that of his predecessors.</p>

<p>Bayezid followed up his father’s great victory at Kossova
over the Serbians, and compelled Stephen, the successor
of Lazar, to sue for peace. The terms of the treaty then
agreed to were very moderate. Instead of being incorporated
in the Ottoman Empire as Bulgaria had been,
Serbia was to be an autonomous State, under vassalage
to the Ottoman Empire, paying tribute in money, and
bound to provide and maintain a contingent of five thousand
soldiers at the disposal of the Sultan. Stephen, its prince,
also gave his sister, Despina, to the Sultan as an additional
wife. He most loyally carried out his promises to Bayezid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
In the great battles of Nicopolis against the Hungarians and
the crusaders from Western Europe, and of Angora against
Timur, the Serbian contingent fought with the utmost
bravery, and there were no more loyal soldiers in the
Ottoman ranks.</p>

<p>Having come to terms with Serbia, Bayezid marched
southwards with his army, and took up a menacing position
near to Constantinople, where the aged and feeble John
Palæologus still reigned, supported by his son Manuel as
co-Emperor. By threatening to promote the cause of
Andronicus, whose eyesight had not been quite extinguished,
after his mad rebellion against the Emperor, the Sultan
compelled the two Emperors to sign a treaty, under which
the remnant of the Greek Empire became an abject vassal
State to that of the Ottomans. The Emperors promised
to pay an annual tribute of thirty thousand pieces of gold
and to supply a contingent of twelve thousand men to the
Ottoman army to be at the disposal of the Sultan for
any purpose he might design. They also undertook to surrender
to the Ottomans the stronghold of Philadelphia,
the only remaining possession of the Byzantine Empire in
Asia Minor. When the officer in command of that city
refused to surrender it, Bayezid insisted on the Greek
Emperor employing his contingent in capturing his own city,
and on his leading the assault on it, with the aid of his
son Manuel, for the purpose of handing it over to himself,
their nominal ally, but crafty and designing foe. It would
be difficult to imagine a lower depth of humiliation and
cowardice than that to which the Emperor and his son
thus descended. These public humiliations were aggravated
by a domestic one. Bayezid, having captured at
sea a vessel bringing a foreign princess as a bride for
Manuel, took a great fancy for the lady, and insisted on
her entering his own harem.</p>

<p>Bayezid next turned his attention to Asia Minor, where
he was mainly ambitious to add to his Empire. His
first effort there was directed against Aidin. After defeating
its Emir and annexing the State, he dealt in the same
way with the Emirs of Sarukhan and Mentsche. He
then made an attack on the city of Smyrna, at that time
in possession of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.
The Knights made a vigorous resistance, and Bayezid, not
having command of the sea, was compelled, after six weeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
to withdraw from the siege. He next, in 1391, attacked
the Emir of Tekke, and took from him what had been
left under his rule by Murad, including the important city
of Adalia. The Ottoman frontier was now conterminous
with that of Karamania, whose Emir, Alaeddin, was brother-in-law
to the Sultan. This family connection was no protection
to him. Bayezid invaded and laid siege to Konia.
He withdrew on Alaeddin agreeing to give up a slice of
his Emirate, including the city of Ak-Sheir.</p>

<p>Having achieved these annexations, for which there was
no justification other than mere greed for the extension of his
Empire, Bayezid returned to Adrianople, leaving his general,
Timurtash, in command of the conquered provinces. The
Greek Emperor John, meanwhile, had been engaged
in putting his capital into a state of defence, and for
this purpose had demolished three of the most beautiful
churches of Constantinople, intending to use their masonry
for the erection of new forts. The Sultan, when he heard
of this, sent word to the Emperors ordering them to desist
from any such work, and threatening to deprive Manuel
of his eyesight. The Emperor had no alternative but to
obey. But this humiliation was the last he had to endure.
He died very shortly afterwards, under the weight of his
cares and anxieties, as some historians say, but according
to others of gout and debauchery. His son, Manuel, who
was detained at the Court of the Sultan, acting as a kind
of Groom of the Chamber, on hearing of his father’s
death, secretly fled and reached Constantinople, where he
was installed as the successor to his father. Bayezid by
way of reprisal for this directed a blockade by land of
Constantinople. There commenced what was virtually a
siege by land of the city, which lasted for seven years, till
the invasion of Asia Minor by Timur caused a diversion and
brought it to an end.</p>

<p>Leaving a part of his forces to conduct this blockade,
and with instructions to harass the Greek garrison by day
and night, Bayezid, with the larger part of his army,
marched through Bulgaria, and compelled the Prince of
Wallachia to submit as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire.
A part of his army then penetrated into Syrmia and engaged
in war with the Hungarians. It was defeated and driven
back, and Sigismund, the Hungarian King, was able to
make a counter-attack, and to capture the important strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>hold
of Nicopolis. He, in turn, was forced to abandon
the city, mainly by the assistance given to Bayezid by
the Wallachians. It was during his retreat through the
Duchy of Hunyadi that Sigismund met and became
enamoured with Elizabeth Moronay. The offspring of this
liaison was the celebrated Hungarian hero Hunyadi the
Great, who later took such an active part against the
Turks.</p>

<p>In 1393, Bayezid sent an army, under command of his
eldest son, Solyman, to invade the northern part of Bulgaria,
which still enjoyed an autonomous existence. Tirnova,
its capital, was taken by storm after a siege of three
weeks. Its inhabitants were sent into Asia Minor as slaves.
He then decided to incorporate the northern part of
Bulgaria in the Ottoman Empire in the same manner as
the southern part had already been treated. This completed
the servitude of the Bulgarian people. Sisman, their
prince, disappeared from the scene, and the ruling family
became extinct. The land was confiscated, except in a
few cases where the owners were allowed to become
Moslems. It was parcelled out to Turks under a feudal
system involving military service, while the cultivators of
the soil were reduced to serfdom.</p>

<p>About this time the fortresses of Nicopolis, Widdin, and
Silistria fell into the hands of the Ottomans and opened
the way into Hungary. Bayezid commenced a system of
raids into that country, not for the purpose, at that time,
of acquiring its territory, but for plunder. His Turkish
‘akinjis,’ or irregulars, spread terror over wide districts,
burning and destroying villages and carrying off their
inhabitants for sale as slaves. He fitted out ships also
with the same object in the newly acquired ports in Asia
Minor, and ravaged the islands of Chios and Negropont
and districts on the coast of Greece.</p>

<p>Bayezid was now compelled by an outbreak in his recent
acquisitions in Asia Minor, fomented by the Emir of
Karamania, to suspend operations on his northern frontier
in Europe and to transfer his army to Asia. He received
at Brusa an envoy from his brother-in-law, Alaeddin of
Karamania, suing for peace. Bayezid replied that the sword
alone could determine the issue between them. He sent
an army at once, under Timurtash, against the Karamanians.
It encountered Alaeddin on the plain of Ak-Tchai.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
The Turkish army was completely successful. Alaeddin
and his two sons were captured, and without waiting for
authority from Bayezid, Timurtash had them hanged.
When Bayezid heard of this treatment of his brother-in-law,
he affected to be greatly distressed and incensed,
but he soon consoled himself by a text from the Koran,
“The death of a prince is less regrettable than the loss
of a province,” and he gave practical application of the
verse by orders to his army to occupy and annex the
whole of Karamania. There was no resistance. Konia
and other cities in the eastern part of the State were
taken. In spite of this, however, Karamania was not at this
time finally incorporated in the Ottoman Empire. After
the invasion of Asia Minor by Timur it recovered its
independence, and it was not till seventy years later that
it was finally subjected and incorporated.</p>

<p>About the same time, 1393-4, Bayezid made further
important conquests in Asia Minor—namely, Samsun,
Cæsarea, and Sivas, the last of the most important
fortresses on the frontier of Armenia. These great
successes both in Europe and Asia were followed by a
period of repose, during which Bayezid gave himself up
to a life of gross debauchery. He was recalled from
this by threats of war on the part of Sigismund, King
of Hungary, and he soon showed that he had lost none
of his vigour and dash.</p>

<p>Sigismund had fretted under the constant raids on his
kingdom, above referred to, and had for some time past
been contemplating war against the Ottomans for the
recovery of the fortresses on the Danube, which were so
great a menace to him. For this purpose he appealed,
in 1395, to the Christian Powers of Europe for assistance.
He was backed up by Pope Boniface IX, who preached
another crusade against the infidels. Through the efforts
of the King of France, Charles VI, a large number of
leading nobles of France were induced to band together,
under the Comte de Nevers, son of the Duke of Burgundy,
a young man of twenty-two years, without any military
experience. A thousand horsemen, chevaliers of good birth
and position, and six thousand attendants and mercenaries
were enrolled in France for this adventure. Others came
from England and Scotland, and from Flanders, Lombardy,
and Savoy. On their march through Germany to Hungary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
they were joined by great numbers of German knights,
under Count Frederick of Hohenzollern, the Grand Prior
of the Teutonic Order, and by a large force of Bavarians,
under the Elector Palatine. Later they were reinforced
by a number of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, under
the command of de Naillac, their Grand Master. When
joined by the Hungarian army, under Sigismund, and by
the contingents from Wallachia and Bosnia, they made up a
total force of about sixty thousand men. The expedition
was in the nature of a crusade, but was more secular
than religious in its aims and methods, and was regarded,
it seems, by most of those engaged in it rather as a kind of
picnic than as a serious campaign. The composite force
collected together at Buda, in Hungary, in the summer of
1396, and thence marched down the Danube to Nicopolis,
capturing Widdin and Sistova on the way. When
passing through Serbia they ravaged wide districts inhabited
by innocent Christians, and emulated, if they did not exceed,
the Ottomans in cruel devastation, as though they were in
an enemy’s country. They established their camp before
Nicopolis in September, but for sixteen days they refrained
from assaulting the fortress, which was bravely defended
by an Ottoman garrison, thus giving time to Bayezid to
collect his army and to advance against the allied forces.</p>

<p>The Christian camp was the scene of riotous living
and gambling. Large numbers of courtesans had accompanied
the crusaders. The whole army was in a state of
indiscipline and disorder. The French knights were
boastful. They spoke with contempt of the Turkish troops,
and could not believe that there was any danger from
them. Bayezid, whose army was full of confidence in
its superiority, was allowed to approach within striking
distance, without any attempt to harass his advance. Even
then the Christians did not believe there was danger.
The Turks suddenly came into contact with them. The
knights were compelled to abandon their gaming tables
and their women, and to face the enemy whom they had
so much despised.</p>

<p>The Ottoman army was preceded by large numbers of
scouts and irregulars. The leaders of the chevaliers,
knowing nothing of the numbers of the Ottomans or of
their methods in war, and utterly despising them, most
rashly proposed an immediate attack by the whole force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of their splendid cavalry. The King of Hungary, who
had had experience of the Ottomans and who knew their
method of masking the main body of their army by
irregulars, was more cautious, and advised that the foot
soldiers of Hungary and Wallachia should be first employed
to meet the attack of the Turkish irregulars, and that
the cavalry should be reserved to meet the main body
of the Ottomans. The chevaliers were furious at this
suggestion. They suspected Sigismund of playing for his
own hand, and of wishing to rob them of the glory of a
great victory. They insisted on an immediate attack.
Sigismund, on hearing of this decision, said, “We shall
lose the day through the great pride and folly of these
French.” And so it turned out.</p>

<p>The chevaliers advanced in splendid array and had no
difficulty in dispersing and slaughtering the mob of
Turkish irregulars. But this impetuous charge spent
their energy and tired their horses. When they were
confronted by the main body of the Ottomans, sixty
thousand in number, they were powerless to resist. They
were surrounded and were compelled to surrender. The
main body of Hungarian foot soldiers, when they came in
contact with the Ottomans, were not more fortunate. The
Wallachians, who formed one of the wings of the army,
when they saw how the battle was going, retired from the
field without a fight. The centre of the Hungarian army,
under Sigismund, supported by the Bavarians, made a most
gallant fight, and might have been successful if it had
not been that the Serbian army, under Prince Stephen,
came at a critical time, in support of the Ottomans, and
turned the scale in their favour. After a battle of only
three hours the Christian allies were completely defeated
with great slaughter on both sides. Ten thousand of the
Christians, including most of the surviving chevaliers, were
taken prisoners. Those who escaped across the Danube
suffered terribly in their retreat through Wallachia. They
were beaten and maltreated by the peasantry, for whom
they had shown no consideration in their advance.</p>

<p>Sigismund and the Grand Prior of Rhodes, at a late
stage of the battle, abandoned the army to its fate. They
escaped in a small boat down the Danube, and were taken
on board by a Venetian vessel, which conveyed them to
Germany through the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Adriatic. On passing the Straits the Turks paraded before
their eyes the knights made captives at Nicopolis. One
of these prisoners thus described what took place:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Osmanlis took us out of the towers of Gallipoli and led us to the
sea, and one after the other they abused the King of Hungary as he passed,
and mocked him and called to him to come out of the boat and deliver
his people; and this they did to make fun of him, and skirmished a long
time with each other on the sea. But they did not do him any harm,
and so he went away.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On the morning of the battle of Nicopolis, Bayezid,
when told of the heavy losses of his own army, and that
in the early part of the battle the chevaliers had massacred
a number of Turks who had surrendered on promise of
life, was greatly incensed. He gave orders that all the
Christian prisoners to the number of ten thousand were
to be put to death in his presence. He made an exception
only in favour of twenty-four of the knights, including
de Nevers, their leader, for whose release a heavy ransom
might be expected. But they were compelled to witness the
execution of their comrades in arms.</p>

<p>On taking leave of them a year later at Brusa, Bayezid
addressed de Nevers in these proud and insolent terms:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>John, I know thee well, and am informed that you are in your own
country a great lord. You are young, and in the future I hope you
will be able to recover with your courage from the shame of the
misfortune which has come to you in your foul knightly enterprise, and
that in the desire of getting rid of the reproach and recovering your
honour you will assemble your power to come against me and give me
battle. If I were afraid of that and wanted to, before your release, I
would make you swear upon your oath and religion that you would never
bear arms against me, nor those who are in your company here. But
no; neither upon you nor any other of those here will I impose this
oath, because I desire, when you have returned to your home, and will
have leisure, that you assemble your power and come against me. You
will find me always ready to meet you and your people on the field of
battle. And what I say to you, you can say in like manner to those
to whom you will have the pleasure of speaking about it, because for
this purpose was I born, to carry arms and always to conquer what is
ahead of me.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Before their final departure, Bayezid treated these knights
to a day’s sport on a regal scale; seven thousand falconers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>were employed on the occasion, and five thousand men led
dogs to pick up the game. The historian does not state
what was the bag resulting from this great battle.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-four knights only one, Marshal Boucicaut,
took up the parting challenge of Bayezid and returned to
the East to make war against him. The others showed no
desire to wipe out the disgrace of their defeat.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>After this great battle at Nicopolis the Ottoman army
made irruptions into Wallachia, Styria, and Hungary. The
city of Peterwardein was captured and eighteen thousand
of its inhabitants were sold into slavery. Another division
invaded Syrmia, and devastated the country between the
Drave and the Danube. The fortresses on the river
taken by the crusaders were recaptured. The raid into
Wallachia was a failure. The Turks engaged in it were
defeated and driven back. Bayezid himself threatened
Buda, in Hungary, but his progress was checked by a
long and painful fit of gout. Gibbon moralizes on this
in the following sentence: “The disorders of the moral
are sometimes corrected by those of the physical world;
and an acrimonious humour falling on a single fibre of
one man may prevent or suspend the misery of nations.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
The invasion of Hungary on this occasion was a failure.</p>

<p>After this campaign Bayezid returned to Adrianople, and
there occupied himself by inflicting further humiliations
on the Greek Empire. He forced Manuel to resign and
imposed John, the son of Andronicus, as its Emperor.
He then issued forth again with his army, in 1397, and
fell like a thunderbolt on Greece, without any warning or
cause of complaint. He marched with his army through
Thessaly, capturing on the way Larissa and Pharsalia. He
passed through Thermopylæ. The mere passage of his
army sufficed to subdue Doris and Locris. His two
generals, Yacoub and Evrenos, then invaded the Peloponnesus.
The latter captured and pillaged Argos. Its
inhabitants, to the number of thirty thousand, were sold
as slaves and deported to Asia. Colonies of Turks were
planted in the Morea. Theodore Palæologus, who acted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>as despot there on behalf of the Greek Empire, agreed
to become tributary of the Sultan.</p>

<p>Returning to Adrianople, Bayezid determined to obtain
immediate possession of Constantinople. The Greek Empire
had been already deprived of nearly all territory outside the
walls of its capital. The Sultan opened proceedings against
it by sending an envoy to the Emperor with this insulting
message:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I dethroned your predecessor, Manuel, it was not in your interest
but in mine. If, then, you want to remain my friend, you must surrender
your crown. I will give you any other government you may wish for.
If you do not consent, I swear by God and the Prophet I will not spare a
soul in your city; I will exterminate all of them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The citizens of Constantinople, rather than experience
the terrible fate which they knew would befall them in
the event of a successful assault by the Ottoman army,
were willing to come to terms. But the Emperor, who was
buoyed up by hope of assistance from the Christian Powers,
refused to acquiesce in a pusillanimous surrender. He
replied to the ambassador in dignified terms: “Tell your
master that, feeble as we are, we know no other power to
whom to address ourselves if it be not God, Who protects
the feeble and humbles the powerful. Let the Sultan do
what he pleases.”</p>

<p>At this stage, and before he could give effect to his
threats, Bayezid was compelled by great events in Asia to
raise the siege of Constantinople. Hitherto, in twelve years
of incessant war, Bayezid had been uniformly successful. He
had annexed the greater part of Asia Minor, Macedonia,
Northern Bulgaria, and Thessaly. He had reduced to
vassalage the Greek Empire itself and Serbia, Wallachia,
Bosnia, and a great part of Greece. He had defeated the
feudal chivalry of Europe in the great battle of Nicopolis.
He had not met with a single reverse. The next two years,
the last of his reign, were to result in disastrous and overwhelming
defeat to him, in his capture and death, and
in the temporary crumpling up of the Turkish Empire.
He came into conflict for the first time with Timur, a
general and a conqueror more resolute, crafty, able, and
cruel than himself.</p>

<p>Timur the Tartar, better known to us as Timurlane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
—Timur the lame, for he had met in early life with an
accident which lamed him—was the greatest, the most ruthless,
and the most devastating of warriors recorded in
all history. Born in 1333, a descendant through his
mother of the great Gengis Khan, he began life as a
petty chief of a Tartar tribe in the neighbourhood of
Samarkand. It was not till he had reached the age of
thirty-five that he achieved eminence over other neighbouring
Tartar States. He then conceived the ambition
of universal conquest. “As there was only one God in
heaven,” he said, “so there should be only one ruler on
earth”—that one was to be himself. He went a long
way towards gaining this object of his ambition, for he
embarked on a career which, in rather less than thirty-five
years, resulted in an empire extending from the Great
Wall of China to the frontier of Asia Minor, and from
the Sea of Aral to the River Ganges and the Persian
Gulf. He had, by this time, conquered twenty-seven
separate States and extinguished nine dynasties. He
effected his purpose, not only by force of arms, but by
a deliberate policy of terrorism. After victory he was
of settled purpose ruthless in cruelties on the greatest
scale.</p>

<p>It was obvious that, sooner or later, he would come into
conflict with what was, at that time, the only other growing
military Power in the world—the Ottoman Empire. The
two potentates had already become neighbours, and causes
of dispute and antagonism were often arising between them.
Each had sheltered refugee princes, whose territories had
been absorbed by the other, and who were engaged in
intrigues to stir up war between the two rivals, in the hope
of regaining their possessions. Insolent messages passed
between the two potentates.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What is the foundation of thy insolence and folly? [wrote Timur to
Bayezid]. Thou hast fought some battles in the woods of Anatolia; contemptible
trophies! Thou hast obtained some victories over the Christians
of Europe; thy sword was blessed by the Apostle of God; and thy
obedience to the precepts of the Koran in waging war against the infidel
is the sole consideration that prevents us from destroying thy country,
the frontier and bulwark of the Moslem world. Be wise in time; reflect;
repent; and avert the thunder of our vengeance which is yet suspended
over thy head. Thou art no more than an ant; why wilt thou seek to
provoke the elephants? Alas, they will trample thee under their feet.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>Bayezid replied in terms of the greatest indignation.
He protested that Timur had never triumphed unless by
his own perfidy and the vices of his foes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thy armies are innumerable: be they so; but what are the arrows
of the flying Tartars against the scimitars and battle-axes of my firm and
invincible Janissaries? I will guard the princes who have implored
my protection; seek them in my tents. The cities of Arzingan and
Erzerum are mine; and unless the tribute be paid I will demand the
arrears under the walls of Tauris and Sultania.</p></blockquote>

<p>And he added an insult of a yet grosser kind which, by
its allusion to the harem, was the worst that could be
devised by a Moslem:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If I fly from thy arms may my wives be thrice divorced from my
bed; but if thou hast not courage to meet me in the field, mayest thou
again receive thy wives after they have thrice endured the embrace of
a stranger.</p></blockquote>

<p>After this interchange of abuse Timur determined, in
1400, to attack and invade Asia Minor from Armenia,
at the head of a horde of armed men, estimated by
historians at not less than eight hundred thousand. He laid
siege to Sivas, in Cappadocia, on the Armenian frontier,
which had only been captured by Bayezid about three
years previously. It was now defended by a garrison
of Turks, under command of Ertoghrul, the eldest son
of Bayezid. The fortifications were immensely strong, but
Timur was ready to sacrifice any number of men in assaulting
and capturing the city. He employed six thousand
miners in undermining its defences with galleries and
propping up the walls temporarily with timber smeared
with pitch. When the mines were completed, fire was
applied to the timber, and the walls gradually sank into
the cavities laid open to them, and afforded entrance to
the assaulting columns. The city was captured. Four
thousand of its defenders were buried alive by order of
Timur, and Ertoghrul was executed.</p>

<p>Bayezid, thus challenged, advanced, in 1401, with an
army of one hundred and twenty thousand men to avenge
the disaster at Sivas. Timur, however, after the capture
of that city, refrained from advancing farther into Asia
Minor. He passed into Syria and captured Damascus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
and thence into Mesopotamia for the capture of Bagdad.
It was not till the next year, 1402, that he determined to
return to Asia Minor and to humble Bayezid. He retraced
his steps to Sivas, and thence, after a further exchange
of insolent messages with the Ottoman Sultan, he went in
search of him towards Angora, taking the route of
Cæsarea and Kir Sheir.</p>

<p>Bayezid had also collected a great army in the east
of Asia Minor, and had finally concentrated it in the neighbourhood
of Angora. He showed none of his previous
skill as a general, though all of his insolence and bravado.
His army was discontented by his avarice, and by his
neglect to pay them out of the well-filled treasury. He
refused to follow the advice of his best generals, who
warned him against meeting Timur’s vast hosts on a
field where they could deploy their whole strength. The
two armies met at last on the plain of Angora, the site
of many previous famous battles. It is almost inconceivable
that Bayezid, in arrogant contempt of his foe, employed
his army, in the face of the enemy, in a great hunt for
game, which led them into a district devoid of water,
where his soldiers suffered terribly, and five thousand are
said to have died of thirst.</p>

<p>On return to their camp they found that Timur had
diverted the stream which supplied it with water. Bayezid
was forced to fight at a disadvantage. The Tartars, who
formed a fourth part of the Ottoman army, were not to be
relied on in this battle. Their sympathies were with their
fellow-Tartars under Timur. Bayezid had committed the
fatal error of placing them in the front line, after his usual
tactics of meeting the first encounter of the enemy with
inferior troops. But in this case the Tartars deserted on
the field of battle. The Serbian contingent, under Prince
Stephen, and other Christian vassal troops fought with the
utmost gallantry and loyalty. But it was in vain. The
whole Ottoman army was outnumbered, overwhelmed, and
routed with great slaughter. Bayezid with his bodyguard
made a last stand. “The Thunderbolt,” says the Turkish
historian, “continued to wield a heavy battle-axe. As a
starving wolf scattering a flock of sheep he scattered the
enemy. Each blow of his redoubtable axe struck in such
a way that there was no need of a second blow.” But in
the end he was overpowered and taken prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>Bayezid for some time after his capture was treated with
unwonted generosity by Timur, who was impressed by
his dignified bearing, in spite of his overwhelming defeat
and humiliation. But after an attempt to escape he was
more rigidly guarded, and was put into fetters at night.
The treatment of him became more cruel and contemptuous.
He was carried by day in the train of Timur, when on
the march, in a litter, which was in effect a cage<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> with
open bars, exposed to the derision and contempt of the
Tartars. His wife, Despina, the Serbian princess, was compelled
to serve Timur with drink at his meals in a state
of nudity, and with other women of Bayezid’s harem was
taken into that of the conqueror. Timur is also said
to have made a footstool of his conquered foe.</p>

<p>Bayezid died of a broken heart after eight months of
humiliation, at the age of forty-eight. During that time
Timur overran the greater part of Asia Minor, capturing
Nicæa and Brusa and many other strongholds from the
Ottomans, and Smyrna from the Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem. The walls of Smyrna were undermined in the
same way as those of Sivas. In two weeks Timur
effected a capture which Bayezid had failed to do in three
times that length of time. The Knights, when they found
that the city was no longer tenable, fought their way
down to their galleys against the crowd of despairing
inhabitants. Most of them escaped to Rhodes and effected
there another settlement. Those who failed to escape were
put to death by Timur, who built a pyramid of their heads.
Everywhere there was ruthless cruelty. When approaching
the city of Ephesus, children came out to meet him
singing songs to appease his wrath. “What is this
noise?” he asked. When told, he ordered his horsemen
to ride over the children. They were trampled to death.</p>

<p>Timur reinstated in their former territories, as tributaries
to his own Empire, most of the petty princes who
had been dispossessed by the Turks, including the Emir
of Karamania. He eventually returned to Samarkand, where
he made preparations for the invasion of China, but before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>this could be realized he died, at the age of seventy-one,
two years after the death of Bayezid. As a result
of his raid into Asia Minor the Ottoman Empire there,
for the time being, completely collapsed. But the Tartars
disappeared without leaving any trace behind them.</p>

<p>If Bayezid’s physical downfall was overwhelming and
humiliating, his moral decadence was even worse, and,
as it turned out, was more permanently injurious to the
people of his Empire by the evil example it set. In
the brief periods of peace, spent at Brusa and Adrianople,
he gave way to self-indulgence and vice of a deplorable
kind. He was the first of his race to break the laws
of the Prophet and to drink too freely of wine. In company
with his Grand Vizier, Ali, he was addicted to drunken
orgies. Still worse, he was tempted by that boon companion
to give way to vice of unmentionable depravity,
condemned by all the world. The Empire was ransacked
for good-looking boys, the sons of Christian parents, who
were compelled to embrace Islamism and to enter the
service of the Court, nominally as pages, but really to pander
to the degrading desire of the Sultan. In adopting such
practices, Bayezid set the fashion to others of his entourage.
The moral infection then spread widely among the upper
classes of society, especially among the judges and ulemas.
There can be little doubt that immorality infected the upper
society of the Empire and was one of the causes which
ultimately led to decadence and ruin.</p>

<p>It is to be noted of Bayezid that in his short but
strenuous career of conquest he did not show any falling
off of vigour and courage as a result of his excesses.
But in his final campaign against Timur his conduct
was so fatuous as to give rise to the belief that his gross
debauchery had resulted in softening of the brain. However
that may have been, he met in Timur a greater
man than himself who, even at the age of seventy, had
lost none of his vigour of mind and body, and who, as
master also of bigger battalions, was practically invincible.</p>

<h2><small>V</small><br /><br />

MAHOMET I<br />

<small>1413-21</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the death of Sultan Bayezid, in captivity, it seemed as
though the Ottoman Empire was doomed to extinction.
Asia Minor had already passed out of its hands, and was
either in possession of the Emirs who had been reinstated
in their territories by Timur, and who had sworn allegiance
to him, or was still in the occupation of the invading
Tartars. It was not to be expected that the Empire in
Europe would survive when it could no longer draw support
from Asia. The Christian populations of Bulgaria, Bosnia,
and Wallachia would soon reassert their independence, and
the Greek Empire might be expected to recover some of
its lost provinces. The Turkish Empire, however, showed
a most unexpected vitality. It survived not only the
invasion of Timur, but civil war, which after the death
of Bayezid broke out between four of his sons. An interregnum
of ten years occurred, during which there was
internecine war between these claimants to his throne. The
Empire emerged from these stupendous difficulties, under
the able rule of the youngest of them, Mahomet I, as
strong as ever, and without the loss of a single province.</p>

<p>Timur’s hosts, after ravaging the whole of Asia Minor,
departed like a swarm of locusts which has denuded a
district of its produce and then seeks fresh ground. They
returned to Central Asia. They left nothing behind in
Asia Minor of Tartar rule, either of an army or of an
administration. The field was left open to the Ottomans
to fight among themselves and their former vassals and
neighbours for such a settlement as could be achieved by
the strongest of them.</p>

<p>Of the six sons of Bayezid, five fought with him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Angora in command of divisions of his army. One of
them, Mustapha, was supposed to be among the slain;
another, Musa, was taken prisoner and shared the captivity
of his father. The other three escaped. The eldest of
them, Solyman, accompanied by the Grand Vizier, Ali, and
Hassan, the Agha of the Janissaries, made his way to
Adrianople, where, on the death of Bayezid, he had himself
proclaimed Sultan, and exercised power as such over the
European provinces of the Empire. Issa, a younger son, fled
to Brusa, where he also claimed to be successor to his father,
and Mahomet, the youngest son, but by far the ablest, retired
to Amasia, a small principality in the north-east of Asia
Minor. He there assumed authority over the district.
After the death of their father these three claimants for
succession to his Empire fought it out between themselves,
and, later on, a fourth claimant was added to the list in
Musa, who had been set free by Timur, in order that he
might convey the dead body of his father for interment at
Brusa.</p>

<p>The earliest conflict was between Mahomet and Issa.
Mahomet offered to divide between them the Ottoman possessions
in Asia. Issa refused and claimed the whole of them.
He was defeated and fled to Europe, where he sought the
assistance of Solyman, who had firmly established himself
in the Ottoman dominions there, and who was now able
to lead an army into Asia Minor in support of Issa.
Mahomet was hard pressed by Solyman. He sent Musa
across the Straits to effect a diversion by raising revolt
against Solyman in Europe. This had the desired effect,
and Solyman was compelled to return to Adrianople. After
his departure Mahomet succeeded in defeating Issa again,
and the latter disappeared and was heard of no more.</p>

<p>In Europe, Solyman and Musa were now in deadly conflict.
Solyman was much the same type of man as his
father—of great vigour and courage in action, but given
to orgies of drink and debauchery. The Agha of the
Janissaries in vain tried to rouse him from the apathy to
which he was often reduced after these bouts. He
threatened to shave the Agha’s beard with his sword. He
was often severe and even cruel to his soldiers, and finally
the Janissaries, incensed by his brutal treatment, his dissolute
habits, and his inability to rouse himself to action, rebelled
against him, at the instance of Hassan, and put him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
death. They then took service under Musa, who became
master of the position in Europe and assumed the title of
Sultan.</p>

<p>After an expedition to Serbia for the purpose of
avenging what he considered their treachery to him in
supporting Mahomet, and where he committed the most
revolting cruelties, Musa returned to Adrianople, and opened
a campaign against the Emperor Manuel, who, after the
death of Bayezid, had superseded Andronicus on the Greek
throne and who supported Mahomet.</p>

<p>The Emperor appealed to Mahomet for assistance.
Mahomet, with a Turkish army, supported by the Serbian
contingent, crossed the Bosphorus in answer to this appeal,
and the strange sight was witnessed of a Turkish army,
under command of one of the Othman race, defending
Constantinople against another Turkish army.</p>

<p>Musa eventually retreated from his lines in front of
Constantinople, and was pursued by Mahomet. When,
later, the two armies came into close touch on the borders
of Serbia, a conflict was avoided by a revolt of Musa’s
troops. The Agha, Hassan, addressed the Janissaries in
the very presence of Musa. “Why,” he said to them,
“do you hesitate to go over to the ranks of the most just
and virtuous of the Othman princes? Why subject yourselves
to be outraged by a man who can take care neither
of himself nor of others?”</p>

<p>Musa, on hearing this harangue to his troops, rushed
at Hassan and slew him. The companion of Hassan struck
at Musa with his sword and wounded him in the hand.
The troops, when they saw that their general was seriously
wounded, were seized with panic. They deserted and went
over to Mahomet. Musa fled with three attendants, and,
later, his dead body was found in a marsh.</p>

<p>Mahomet was now in undisputed command of the Empire
as Sultan. He reigned as such for only eight years. He
showed, during that time, infinite skill and patience, as
a statesman equally as a general, in restoring, consolidating,
and maintaining his Empire. He was ardently desirous
of peace. To the representatives of Serbia, Wallachia,
and Albania he said: “Forget not to tell your masters
that I grant peace to all, and that peace I will accept
from all. May God be against the breakers of peace.”</p>

<p>He kept on the best of terms with the Greek Emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
with whom he had made a defensive alliance, and restored
to him certain cities on the coast of the Black Sea and in
Thessaly. He had frequent causes, however, for the use
of his army, and for showing his skill as a general. He
compelled the Emirs of Karamania, Kermia, and other
principalities in Asia Minor, who had promised allegiance
to Timur, to renew their vassalage to the Ottoman Empire.
Two or three times the Karamanian prince revolted and
endeavoured to assert complete independence. As often
Mahomet defeated him, but contented himself with asserting
supremacy, and did not insist upon the incorporation of
his territory with the Empire. He also defeated an attempt
of a Turkish upstart to create an independent State at
Smyrna and Aidin. He put down a dangerous revolt of
Dervishes and extinguished the sect. He came into conflict
at sea with the Republic of Venice, and though he
was worsted, and his fleet of galleys was destroyed, he
succeeded in making an honourable peace.</p>

<p>As a ruler of his Empire he showed many great qualities.
He gained the appellation which is best translated
into English as the “Great Gentleman”—and right well
he deserved it. He was magnanimous and just. He
strictly observed his promises. He knew that his Empire
could not be maintained by force alone, but that justice and
clemency were necessary. His Christian subjects were everywhere
treated with consideration. He would not tolerate
cruelty to them. He was a liberal patron of literature,
and in his short reign the Ottomans first showed a bent
for poetry. It was a blot on his fame that he caused his
youngest brother to be deprived of his sight, and that he
put to death his nephew, the son of Solyman, lest either of
them should dispute the throne with himself or his son after
him. His experience of his brothers and the history of
his family doubtless convinced him that no member of
the Othman race would be content with any position short
of the Sultanate. This may not be a moral justification,
but it is an explanation which, in view of the ethics of
the times, must prevent too severe a judgment. Though
Mahomet in his short reign, after attaining full command
of the Empire, made no extension of it, he must be regarded
practically as one of its founders and as among
its most eminent and successful rulers. He owed his
success over his brothers to his moral ascendancy and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the great reputation which he achieved with his troops
for his high qualities as a ruler even more than to his
prowess as a general. The emergence of the Empire
from the extreme difficulties into which it fell from the
Mongolian invasion must have been due to the fact that
the Ottomans at that time were much superior to the
Greeks and the other Christian communities in all the
qualities which tend to make a stable government.</p>

<p>Mahomet died of apoplexy in 1421 at the early age of
forty-seven. He was buried at Brusa in a mausoleum near
to the splendid building known as the Green Mosque,
which he had himself erected.</p>

<h2><small>VI</small><br /><br />

MURAD II<br />

<small>1421-51</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Murad</span> succeeded his father in the Sultanate as second
of the name. He reigned for thirty years, including two
short periods when he abdicated and retired into private
life. But on each occasion he was compelled by the
exigencies of the State, and the youth and inexperience
of his son and successor, to resume the throne. He much
resembled his father in vigour and capacity as a general
and in his desire to act justly.</p>

<p>At the very commencement of Murad’s reign the Greek
Emperor Manuel, by an almost incredible act of folly,
hoping to take advantage of Murad’s youth and inexperience,
let loose from confinement a man who claimed,
whether rightly or not was never clearly established, to
be Mustapha, the son of Sultan Bayezid, who had disappeared
after the battle of Angora. Manuel entered into
a treaty with this claimant to the Ottoman throne, by which,
in the event of his succeeding in establishing his succession,
the city of Gallipoli and all the cities on the shores
of the Black Sea, taken from the Greek Empire by the
Turks, were to be restored to it.</p>

<p>In spite of this scandalous treachery to Islam, the so-called
Mustapha succeeded in raising a large army in
Europe, with which he defeated the troops who adhered
to Murad. He then crossed the Dardanelles into Asia
with his army in vessels supplied by the Emperor Manuel.
Murad showed all the vigour and capacity of his race in
dealing with this emergency. He won over the greater
part of Mustapha’s army, who were disaffected. He defeated
what remained. Mustapha was driven across the Straits
again to Gallipoli, where he was besieged, captured, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
hanged, as the best proof, it was said, that he was an
impostor.</p>

<p>Murad, having defeated this claimant to his throne,
determined to avenge the perfidy of the Emperor Manuel
and to put an end to the Greek Empire by the capture of
Constantinople. For this purpose he collected an army
of veterans. He invested the city, making a long line of
great earthworks from the Golden Horn to the Sea of
Marmora. From this he bombarded the city walls by
cannon, then for the first time used by the Ottoman army,
but which were not as yet very effective. He also used
movable towers, from which assaults could be made on the
walls of the city. He proclaimed that the great wealth of
the capital would be the prize of the soldiers if the assault
on it were successful. He made a special promise to
a band of five hundred Dervishes, who were to lead the
assault, that all the nuns in the city would be given to
them as concubines. In spite of these great inducements
to victory, the assault was unsuccessful. The Greeks defended
the walls of the city with the utmost heroism,
assisted, it was said, by a timely apparition of the Holy
Virgin, which stimulated their efforts and depressed the
assailants. Murad would probably have been successful
with the overwhelming forces at his disposal if he had
persisted in the siege, but he was compelled to raise it
by a diversion cleverly contrived by the Greek Emperor.</p>

<p>A rival to the Sultan was set up in Asia in another
Mustapha, a younger brother of Murad, who had not been
put to death in pursuance of the fratricidal policy of his
family. This new claimant was supported by the Karamanians
and Kermians, and with their aid he defeated
an Ottoman army in Asia Minor. Murad found it necessary
to abandon the siege of Constantinople, and to transfer
his main army to Asia Minor for the purpose of dealing
with this danger to his throne. He came to close quarters
as quickly as possible with Mustapha’s army, and defeated
it. Mustapha was taken prisoner and was hanged at once
by his captors, without giving an opportunity to Murad
to exercise his clemency in favour of his brother, had
he so willed it. Murad then occupied himself by reducing
the Karamanian and other Emirs to complete subjection
to his Empire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Emperor Manuel died, and was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
by John Palæologus. Murad, in lieu of renewing the
siege of Constantinople, was content to make another treaty
with the new Emperor, imposing on him a heavy tribute and
stripping him of almost every possession beyond the walls
of his capital. The Empire thus obtained a reprieve for
a few brief years.</p>

<p>In the case of Salonika, which had been recently sold
by the Greek Emperor to the Republic of Venice, now
desirous of effecting a lodgment in Macedonia, Murad
refused to recognize the right of the Emperor to transfer
to a foreign Power a city which at one time had been
under Ottoman rule. It had three times in the last hundred
years been captured by the Ottomans, and had as often
been recaptured by the Greeks. Murad led an army, in
1430, to attack it, and, after a vigorous resistance by
the Venetians, captured it by assault, and finally annexed
the city and its district to the Turkish Empire. It
was thought that Murad showed great clemency in not
allowing his soldiers to indulge in a wholesale massacre.
The Greek inhabitants, however, were sold into slavery,
and their numbers were so great that a good-looking girl
was sold for the price of a pair of boots.</p>

<p>The suppression of rebellion in Asia Minor, the subjection
of the Greek Emperor to the position of a humble
vassal, and the capture of Salonika had occupied Murad
for some years. Later he was involved in long struggles
with his neighbours, the Hungarians, on the northern
boundaries of his Empire. The Ottomans were engaged
in constant raids across the Danube, where vast districts
were devastated, and thousands of their population were
carried off as captives for sale as slaves. There arose
about this time in Hungary a national hero, the celebrated
Hunyadi, a natural son of the late King Sigismund. He
was a born leader of men, not a great general, but a most
valiant fighter. He had gained great distinction in war
in other directions. He now became the soul of hostility
against the Ottomans. He was known as the White Knight,
on account of his silver armour, which always shone in
the van of the impetuous charges of his cavalry. He was
rightly regarded by his countrymen as a patriot and a
national hero. None the less, he was a bloodthirsty ruffian.
He made a practice of massacring all the prisoners taken in
battle. He found pleasure in having this effected, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
presence, at banquets, where the guests were entertained
by the shrieks of the dying men.</p>

<p>Hunyadi for twenty years was a terror to the Ottoman
armies. His first encounter with them was at Hermannstadt,
north of the Danube, which was invested by an
army of eighty thousand Ottomans. He led an army of
twenty thousand Hungarians against them, in relief of the
fortress, and inflicted a severe defeat on them, in despite
of great disparity of numbers. Twenty thousand of
the Ottomans were killed, including the general. The
others were dispersed. Murad sent another army of eighty
thousand men against him, under another Pasha. Hunyadi
again defeated it with great slaughter at Varsag.</p>

<p>These notable victories roused great enthusiasm in
Europe. It was determined to take the offensive against the
Ottomans, and to make another effort to drive them out
of Europe. A coalition was formed for the purpose between
Hungary and Poland, then united under King Ladislaus,
and Wallachia and Bosnia. Serbia, which under its king,
Stephen Lazariwitch, had been the firm ally of the
Ottomans, and had supported them in many campaigns
in Asia and Europe, was now induced to abandon this
alliance and, under Stephen’s successor, George Brancowitch,
to join the confederacy against the Ottomans.
The Pope, Eugenius, was most active in support of this
combination. His legate, Cardinal Julian Cesarini, led an
armed force in support of it. Money was raised for the
purpose of the war by a great sale of indulgences to the
faithful in every part of Europe. A large contingent of
French and German knights joined the allied army. It
was, in fact, another crusade, prompted by religious zeal
on behalf of Christianity against Islam. The allied army
was under the nominal command of Ladislaus, but Hunyadi
was its real leader.</p>

<p>The Republics of Venice and Genoa gave their support,
and as, at this time, the Ottomans had no naval force, it
was hoped that these Powers, by means of their numerous
and powerful galleys, would prevent the transfer to Europe
of Murad’s main army, which was again engaged in conflict
with the Karamanians in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The allied army, under these favourable circumstances,
crossed the Danube in 1443. It defeated an Ottoman
army on the banks of the Masova and again at Nisch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
It then crossed the Balkan range in winter—an operation
of extreme difficulty, which has since only twice been
effected, by General Diebitsch and General Gourko—and
again defeated the Turks in a battle at the foot of
these mountains. Strange to say, instead of marching
onwards to Adrianople, as Diebitsch did in 1829, Hunyadi
was content with the laurels already achieved, and returned
with his army to Buda, where he displayed his trophies
and received a triumph.</p>

<p>Murad, on hearing of the retreat of the Hungarians across
the Balkans, determined to come to terms with them, and
not to pursue them again across the Danube. With some
difficulty, and in spite of the sullen opposition of Cardinal
Julian and the French contingent, a treaty was agreed to,
at Szegeddin, with Ladislaus, by which Serbia was to be
freed from dependence on the Ottoman Empire and
Wallachia was to be ceded to Hungary. The treaty was
to be in force for ten years. It was solemnly sworn
to on the Gospel and the Koran by Ladislaus and
Murad.</p>

<p>While this treaty was being negotiated Murad, weary
of war, and desirous of spending the remainder of his life
in sensual enjoyments which had so long been denied to
him, decided to abdicate his throne. He was still in the
full vigour of life at the age of forty-one, though he was
said to be growing rather fat. He did not propose, like
the Emperor Charles V, to retire to a monastery, but rather,
like Diocletian the Roman Emperor, to a luxurious palace,
surrounded by beautiful gardens, which he had prepared
for his retreat at Magnesia. On the ratification of the
treaty of Szegeddin, in 1444, he carried out this purpose,
and his son Mahomet, at the age of fourteen, was
proclaimed Sultan in his place.</p>

<p>When this became known to the Hungarians a revulsion of
opinion took place against the recent treaty with the Turks.
The Hungarian Diet determined, at the instance of Cardinal
Julian, backed up by the Pope, to break the treaty. News
had arrived of a fresh outbreak of the Karamanians. The
fleets of Genoa, Venice, and Burgundy were masters of
the Hellespont and would, it was believed, prevent the
Ottoman army in Asia Minor from crossing into Europe.
The opportunity for crushing the Turks and driving them
out of Europe seemed to be most favourable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Is it now [said Cardinal Julian to the Hungarian Diet] that you will
desert expectations and your own fortunes? Is it to your God and your
fellow-Christians that you have pledged your faith? That prior obligation
annihilates a rash and sacrilegious oath to the enemies of Christ. His
vicar on earth is the Roman Pontiff, without whose sanction you can
neither promise nor perform. In his name I absolve your perjury and
sanctify your arms. Follow my footsteps in the path of glory and salvation;
and, if you still have scruples, devolve on my head the punishment
and the sin.</p></blockquote>

<p>“This mischievous casuistry,” says the historian Gibbon,
“was seconded by his respectable character and the levity
of popular assemblies.” The Hungarian Diet resolved on
war, and King Ladislaus, in spite of his recent oath, determined
to break the treaty. Hunyadi was, in the first
instance, strongly opposed to this, but his assent was
obtained by the promise of the throne of Bulgaria, in
the event of the defeat of the Ottomans and the conquest
of that province. The Prince of Serbia, who had regained
his independence by the treaty, was persuaded to join
with the allies by the promise of an addition to his
kingdom.</p>

<p>It was decided to send an army at once against the
Ottomans. But it was a much reduced one in comparison
with that which had so recently crossed the Balkans. Most
of the French and German knights and their attendants
had already gone home. Not more than ten thousand
remained under Hunyadi. They were joined by five
thousand Wallachians. They invaded Bulgaria, and then,
instead of crossing the Balkans, descended the Danube
to the coast and thence marched to Varna. Meanwhile
the Ottomans, in great alarm and fearing the incompetence
of the young Mahomet to conduct a great war, induced
Murad to emerge again from his retreat. He hastily
gathered together an army in Asia Minor. He bribed the
Genoese, at the rate of a ducat for each man, to convey
it across the Hellespont. He arrived in front of Varna
unexpectedly, before the Christian army knew of his intentions.
His army greatly outnumbered that of King Ladislaus.
In spite of this, the two wings of it were driven
back with great slaughter. Murad, in command of the
centre of his army, for the moment and for the only time
in his life, lost his presence of mind and was disposed
to fly. But the Beglerbey of Anatolia laid hold of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
bridle of his horse and urged him to fight it out. The
battle was renewed. The Janissaries stood firm and
successfully repulsed the main body of the Christians.
Ladislaus was unhorsed and asked for quarter. But he
was put to death on the field. His head was stuck upon
a lance and was held up by the side of another lance
which bore on high a copy of the violated treaty. The
Christians, when they saw the head of their dead king
in its soldier’s helmet thus held aloft, were struck with
panic and fled precipitately. Hunyadi escaped with difficulty.
Cardinal Julian expiated by death on the field his
sin in advising the breach of the treaty. Two other bishops
shared his fate. Never was defeat and disaster more richly
deserved. Two-thirds of the Christian army were slain
in the battle, and even greater numbers, though a less
proportion, of the Ottomans shared their fate.</p>

<p>Murad, having won this great victory, again, a second
time, abdicated his throne and returned to his retreat at
Magnesia, and again the young Mahomet was invested as
Sultan. Though history supplies cases of great kings
seeking retirement from the cares of office, and of some of
them being induced to resume their thrones, it records no
other case of a second abdication and a second resumption.
Murad was very soon recalled from his abode of
pleasure. A serious outbreak of the Janissaries occurred
at Adrianople. They ravaged the city and committed great
atrocities. The ministers of the young Sultan were greatly
alarmed. They felt that only a strong hand could keep
a check on the unruly Janissaries. Murad was again summoned
from his retreat. The young Mahomet was induced
to go on a hunting expedition. In his absence Murad
again made his appearance at Adrianople and resumed
power. Mahomet, on his return from hunting, found that his
father was again in the saddle. Murad was received by his
troops with a great ovation, and even the unruly Janissaries
gave in their submission to him. He did not again seek
retirement at Magnesia. He reigned for seven more years—another
period of almost incessant war. He first made
an invasion of the Morea, which the Greek Emperor’s
brothers had divided between them and governed as petty
princes, or despots, as they were called. Murad had no
difficulty in storming and capturing the fortification by
which the isthmus of Corinth was defended. He com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>pelled
the two despots to accept the position of vassals
under the Empire.</p>

<p>Murad then again turned his attention to Serbia and
Hungary. He defeated the combined forces of Hungary,
Serbia, and Bosnia, under Hunyadi, on the field of Kossova,
where in 1389 Murad I had first subdued the Serbians.
As a result of this great battle Serbia lost its independence
and was finally incorporated as an integral part of the
Ottoman Empire. Bosnia became a tributary State.</p>

<p>Murad was less fortunate in his efforts to subdue the
Albanians. These people were under the leadership of
George Castriota—commonly called Scanderbeg—who had
been brought up at Murad’s Court as a Mussulman, and had
learned the art of war from him, but who had abjured
Islam, with a view to leadership of the Albanians. He
carried on a guerrilla war against the Ottoman invaders
with great success, and Murad was unable to complete
the conquest of the State. This was practically the only
failure of Murad’s adventurous life. His generals met
with many defeats at the hand of Hunyadi, but Murad
retrieved them in the two battles in which he came in
conflict with the great Hungarian hero. He died of
apoplexy in 1451.</p>

<p>Looking back at his career, it does not appear that he
made war with ambitious objects to aggrandize his Empire.
War was, in almost every case, forced upon him. Three
times the Prince of Karamania declared war against him,
and three times Murad defeated him, and was content
with insisting on the vassalage of the province and not
on its extinction and incorporation with the Empire. It
has been shown how perfidious was the conduct of the Greek
Emperor, and how fully justified Murad was in reducing
his territory to the narrowest limits. Murad’s attack on
Salonika when in the hands of the Venetian Republic was
equally justified, for the Greek Emperor had no right to
sell it, and thus invite a foreign Power to make a lodgment
there. The wars on the northern frontier were forced
upon him by the Hungarians and the Christian Powers
in alliance with them. They appealed to arms, and victory
decided against them. It will be seen that as a net result
of Murad’s reign the Ottoman Empire was extended during
these thirty years by the acquisition of many petty principalities
in Asia Minor, by the complete subjection of Serbia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and Bosnia, the conquest of Salonika and its district, and
by the conversion of the Morea into a tributary State. It
was, however, reduced by the loss of Wallachia as a vassal
State.</p>

<p>Gibbon, quoting from a Turkish historian, says:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Murad was a just and valiant prince, of a great soul; patient of labour,
learned, merciful, religious, charitable; a lover and encourager of the
studious and of all who excelled in any art or science. No man obtained
more or greater victories. Belgrade alone withstood his attacks. Under
his reign the soldier was ever victorious, the citizen rich and secure. If he
subdued any country, his first care was to build mosques and caravansaries,
hospitals, and colleges.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though, <i>more suo</i>, Gibbon suggests doubts whether
such praise could be justified in the case of a Sultan
“whose virtues are often the vices most useful to himself
or most agreeable to his subjects,” he admits that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>the justice and moderation of Murad are attested by his conduct and
acknowledged by Christians themselves, who consider a prosperous reign
and a peaceful death as the reward of his singular merits. In the vigour
of his age and military power he seldom engaged in war till he was
justified by a previous and adequate provocation. In the observance
of treaties his word was inviolate and sacred.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p></blockquote>

<h2><small>VII</small><br /><br />

MAHOMET II, ‘THE CONQUEROR’<br />

<small>1451-81</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Mahomet, the eldest son of Murad, at the age of fourteen,
had been reckoned too feeble to cope with the emergencies
of the State, it is very certain that he soon made wonderfully
rapid progress. At the age of twenty-one, when he
again mounted the throne on the death of his father, he was
amply, and almost precociously, endowed with many of the
best, and many also of the worst, qualities of an autocrat,
and was quite able alone to take command of the State.
He was undoubtedly the ablest man that the house of
Othman had as yet produced, not only as a general, but
as a statesman. He had also great intellectual capacity
and literary attainments. He spoke five languages fluently.
He was the most proud and ambitious of his race and the
most persistent in pursuing his aims. He combined with
these high qualities, however, extreme cruelty and perfidy
and sensuality of the grossest and vilest kind. He differed
from his predecessors in his craving for absolute power,
free from control by his ministers, and in his reckless
disregard of human life. Hitherto, from Othman to
Murad II, the Sultans had been in intimate association with
their viziers and generals, and had shared their meals with
them. They were accessible to their subjects, high and low.
Mahomet was very different. He was the true despot after
the Oriental fashion. He held himself aloof. He took his
meals alone. He made no confidants. He treated his
viziers and pashas as though they were his slaves. He
had no regard for their lives. There were men in his
personal service who were adepts at striking off heads by
single blows of their scimitars. Two at least of Mahomet’s
Grand Viziers were put to death in this way in his presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
without warning or compunction. This levelling process
was not apparently objected to by his subjects.</p>

<p>On hearing at Magnesia of the death of his father,
Mahomet, who was eager to resume power, mounted at once
an Arab horse, and exclaiming, “Let all who love me
follow!” he rode to the Hellespont, and thence crossed to
Gallipoli and made his way to Adrianople. He was there
again acclaimed as Sultan, not, however, without having to
submit to onerous presents to the Janissaries, a bad precedent
which was later always followed on the accession of a
Sultan. The first act of his reign was to direct that his
brother, an infant son of Murad, by his latest wife, a Serbian
princess, should be put to death. He feared that the child,
when grown up, might dispute the throne with him, on the
ground that its mother was a legitimate wife of royal descent,
while he himself (Mahomet) was only the son of a slave. A
high officer of the Court was directed to drown the child in
a bath. This was effected at the very moment when the
mother was engaged in offering her congratulations to the
new Sultan on his accession. The foul deed created a very
bad impression, and Mahomet found it expedient to disown
the act. He did so by directing the execution of the officer
who had carried out his order. He compelled the mother,
in spite of her royal rank, to marry a slave, an outrageous
insult to the Serbian prince and to the memory of his father.</p>

<p>From the earliest moment of his accession it became
clear that Mahomet intended to signalize his reign by the
capture of Constantinople. With this view, he came to
terms for a three years’ truce with Hunyadi and the Hungarians.
He chastised and then gave easy terms to the
Karamanians, and accepted as a wife the daughter of their
prince. He sent an army to the Peloponnesus to prevent
the two brothers of the Greek Emperor, who were ruling
there, from lending their aid to the Greeks of Constantinople.
He directed the erection of a great fortress on the European
side of the Bosphorus, at its narrowest point opposite to
another, which had been erected by Bayezid, very near to
the capital, so as to command the Straits. When the Greek
Emperor sent an envoy to protest against this, Mahomet
replied:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I make no threats against your city. By assuring the safety of my
country I am not infringing any treaty. Have you forgotten the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>extremity to which my father was reduced when your Emperor, in league
with the Hungarians, endeavoured to prevent his crossing to Europe by
closing the Straits against him? Murad was compelled to ask for the
assistance of the Genoese. I was at Adrianople at the time and was
very young. The Mussulmans were in great alarm and you Greeks
insulted them. My father took an oath at the battle of Varna to erect a
fort on the European side. This oath I will fulfil. Have you the right or
the power to prevent my doing what I wish on my own territory? The
two sides of the Straits are mine—that of Asia Minor because it is peopled
by Ottomans, that of Europe because you are unable to defend it. Tell
your master that the Sultan who now reigns in no way resembles his
predecessors. My power goes beyond their vows. I permit you now to
withdraw, but in the future I will have flayed alive those who bring me
such messages.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p></blockquote>

<p>No more envoys were sent to him after this by the Greeks.
Their Emperor, Constantine—the last of his line—had succeeded
his brother three years before the accession of
Mahomet. He was a brave and conscientious prince, who
gave lustre to the last days of the Empire. But he was most
unwise and provocative in his conduct to the new Sultan,
evidently under the belief that he had to deal with the
inexperienced youth who had been displaced by Murad
six years previously. He threatened to let loose, as a rival
claimant to the Ottoman throne, Orkhan, a grandson of
Bayezid, who was under his charge, if a larger allowance
was not given for his maintenance. Mahomet contemptuously
rejected the claim. The Grand Vizier, Khalil, who
was suspected of being in the pay of the Greeks, warned
the Emperor of his extreme folly. “Your madness,” he
said to the Greek ambassador, “will put Constantinople
in the hands of the Sultan. Proclaim Orkhan Sultan in
Europe, call in the Hungarians to your aid, retake what
provinces you can, and you will speedily see the end of the
Greek Empire.”</p>

<p>The new fortress was completed in the autumn of 1452.
It was then seen that, in combination with the fortress on
the opposite shore, it gave complete command of the Straits
to the Ottomans. Venetian vessels which attempted to
pass were captured and their crews were sawn in halves.
Mahomet then declared his intention to attack Constantinople.
In an address to his principal pashas, after
describing the conquests made by his predecessors in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>Europe and Asia, he pointed out that the great barrier to
further progress was this city and the army of the Emperor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The opposition [he said] must be ended; these barriers must be
removed. It was for them to complete the work of their fathers. They
had now against them a single city, one which could not resist their
attacks; a city whose population was greatly reduced and whose former
wealth had been diminished by Turkish sieges, and by the continued
incursions made by his ancestors upon its territories; a city which was
now only one in name, for in reality its buildings were useless and its
walls abandoned and for the great part in ruins. Even from its weakness,
however, they knew that from its favourable position, commanding both
land and sea, it had greatly hindered their progress and could still
hinder it, opposing their plans and being always ready to attack them.
Openly or secretly it had done all it could against them. It was the city
which had brought about the attack by Timerlane and the suffering which
followed. It had instigated Hunyadi to cross the Danube, and on every
occasion and in every possible manner had been their great enemy. The
time had now come when, in his opinion, it should be captured or wiped
off the face of the earth. One of two things: he would either have it
within his Empire or he would lose both. With Constantinople in his
possession, the territories already gained could be safely held and more
would be obtained; without it, no territory that they possessed was safe.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the ensuing winter (1452) Mahomet made every preparation
at Adrianople for a campaign in the next year.
Having no means of casting cannons, which at that time
were coming into use in European armies, he tempted a
Wallachian, who was experienced in such work, and who
was in the service of the Greeks, to come over to his side
for higher pay, and devised with him a cannon of enormous
size, firing stone balls of 2-1/2 feet in diameter, and many
other smaller, but still large, guns throwing balls of 150 lb.
weight, for use against the walls of Constantinople. He
also constructed a large fleet of war vessels propelled by
oars, biremes and triremes, to be used in the siege of the
city. He was most active and eager, working day and
night in concerting plans with his generals for his great
purpose. Early in the following year (1453) he collected in
front of the walls of Constantinople an army, estimated at
a hundred and fifty thousand men, including twelve thousand
Janissaries, and a vast number of irregulars and camp
followers eager for the sack of the great city.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>
<p>Constantine, on his part, was equally engaged in making
preparations for the defence of his capital. He collected
supplies of every kind. He did his best to repair and
strengthen the walls of the city, which had been neglected
and badly repaired by fraudulent Greek contractors. He
invited the aid of the Christian princes of Western Europe
for the coming struggle. In this view, and in the hope of
getting full support from the Pope, he agreed to a scheme
of union between the Greek and Latin Churches, in which
everything was conceded to the latter. A great service
was held at St. Sophia to ratify this union. Cardinal
Isidore, the legate of the Pope, a Greek by birth, presided.
It was attended by the Emperor and all his Court, clergy,
and the officers of State. This gave great offence to the
main body of the Greek clergy, and to the great majority
of the people of Constantinople. There was implacable
hatred between the members of the two Churches, and not
even the grave peril of the State could induce them to compose
their differences. St. Sophia was deserted by its
congregation. It was thought to be polluted by the service.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
The Grand Duke Notaras, the second person in the State
after the Emperor, in command of all the forces, was
specially offended. He even went the length of saying
in public that he would rather see the turban of the Turks
at Constantinople than the hat of a cardinal. It resulted
that the Greeks were divided into two parties. Priests
refused to give the sacrament to dying men not of their
party. The Churches refused to contribute out of their
vast wealth to necessities of the State. Constantine was
seriously embarrassed and weakened by the division among
his people. Of a total population of the city, reduced
as it was, as compared with the past, and estimated at
a hundred thousand, not more than six thousand took up
arms in support of Constantine against the Turks.</p>

<p>The appeals to the Western Powers resulted in a certain,
but very insufficient, number of volunteers from Southern
Europe giving their services to support the Greek cause
in its final struggle with the Moslems. Seven hundred
Genoese came under the command of Giustiniani, an able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>soldier of fortune, who proved to be the main support of
Constantine. Others had come with Cardinal Isidore, at the
instance of the Pope, and with some small amount of money
from the same quarter. There were Catalans and Aragonese
from Spain, but the number of these recruits from Western
Europe did not exceed three thousand. The total force
under the command of Constantine for the defence of the city
amounted to no more than eight thousand. It is strange
that there were no volunteers from France and Germany,
or from Hungary and Poland, from whence so many
crusaders had volunteered in previous years to drive the
Turks out of Europe. Nor was there any valid assistance
in men and money from the numerous Greeks in the Levant.
The unfortunate Constantine was not only very deficient
in men, but his resources in money were very low. He
had, however, in his service twenty powerful galleys well
manned, and three galleys had come from Venice.</p>

<p>It would seem that the cause of Constantine did not much
interest Europe, and did not even meet with an effective
support among the Greeks themselves.</p>

<p>The city of Constantinople, as it then existed, was situate
between the Golden Horn, its great harbour, and the sea of
Marmora. Its land frontage, distant about nine miles from
the entrance to the harbour, was four miles in length. It
was protected by a triple line of walls, the two inner of
which were very massive, flanked by towers at distances of
170 feet. There was a space of 60 feet between these
walls. The third and outer wall was a crenelated breastwork
on the other side of a fosse, of a width of 60 feet. This
powerful line of defence had been devised by the Emperor
Theodosius II about a thousand years ago and had protected
the city in twenty sieges. Before the invention of cannon it
was practically impregnable.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> There were also fortifications
extending for about nine miles on the side of the
Golden Horn. The eight thousand men were too few even
for effective defence of the four miles of walls, which were
to be attacked directly by the Ottoman army, to say nothing
of the fortifications along the side of the Golden Horn.
The defence, however, with these limited means, was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>spirited one. It showed that if the Greek Emperor had
been adequately supported by the Western Powers Mahomet
might not have been able to capture the city.</p>

<p>The siege was commenced by Mahomet on April 6,
1453. Much time had been occupied in conveying the
cannon from Adrianople. There were two very interesting
incidents in the siege which are worth recording. The one
was the breaking of the close blockade of the port by four
powerful and well-manned Genoese galleys, bringing provisions
and stores to the beleaguered city from Chios. They
sailed across the Marmora and up the Bosphorus with a
strong breeze in their favour. The Sultan sent against
them a hundred and forty of his fleet of smaller vessels
propelled by oars. They found great difficulty in stemming
the heavy sea. The four larger Genoese vessels came down
on the smaller craft, crashing against them and shivering
their oars. Their crews hurled big stones on the Turkish
galleys and emitted against others the inextinguishable fire
of which the Greeks had the secret. The Turkish boats
could make no headway against the superior weight of the
bigger vessels. A large number of them were sunk with
serious loss of life. When near to the entrance of the
harbour the wind died off and the Genoese vessels were
in imminent peril, surrounded as they were by the numerous
Turkish craft. But at the last moment an evening breeze
sprang up. The Genoese vessels were able to force their
way through. The chain which prevented ingress to the
harbour was lowered, and the relieving vessels were admitted.</p>

<p>The Sultan had watched the naval battle from the shore.
He spurred his horse some distance into the shallow sea
in the hope of animating his sailors to greater efforts. He
was bitterly disappointed at this first engagement of his new
fleet. The next morning he sent for the admiral, Balta
Oghlou, a sturdy Bulgarian by birth, and bitterly reproached
him for his failure. He directed the admiral to be laid
on the ground and held there by four strong men, while he
was bastinadoed. Some historians state that the Sultan
himself belaboured the unfortunate admiral with his mace.</p>

<p>The other incident, growing out of the naval defeat,
was that Mahomet, on finding that his small craft, propelled
only by oars, were of little effect against the powerful
vessels at the disposal of the Greeks, determined to transfer
a large number of them from the Bosphorus to the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
part of the harbour, where the bigger vessels could
not engage them, owing to the shallow depth of water,
and where they would be of use against the inner defence
of the city. For this purpose Mahomet directed the construction
of a broad plank road from Tophane, on the
Bosphorus, across the hill intervening between it and the
head of the Golden Horn. This road was well greased with
tallow, and the vessels were dragged up it with windlasses
and oxen. The descent on the other side of the
hill was easy enough. The scheme was not quite a novelty,
as an operation of the same kind, though on a smaller scale,
had been attempted elsewhere. It was carried out with
striking success; and in one night eighty of the Turkish
galleys were transferred in this way to the upper harbour.
Mahomet also constructed a pontoon bridge across the
harbour, on which batteries were erected. The two schemes
together enabled him to attack the Greek defences along
the line of the harbour, and compelled Constantine to
withdraw many men from the defence of the landward
walls, where the main attack was made.</p>

<p>The young Sultan took a most active part in the siege
work. He traced the lines of fourteen batteries from which
the walls were bombarded. The first great cannon was
a failure. It burst at the first shot and blew to pieces
the Wallachian who had cast it. It was recast, however,
and two others of the same size were also cast. About two
hundred smaller guns were used. They threw stone balls<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
against the walls and towers of the city, and ultimately
succeeded in effecting a breach. There can be no doubt
that the capture of the city was mainly due to the provision
of these great guns, which were far above anything previously
used against fortresses. The Greeks also used
cannons in defence, but the parapets of the walls were
not wide enough to allow of the recoil of the guns, and
where it was possible to use them the walls suffered from
the concussion. Gunpowder was also deficient.</p>

<p>After seven weeks of siege the bombardment effected
breaches in the walls at three points such as to give
Mahomet every hope of success in a final assault. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>principal breach was at St. Romanus, where the outer of
the two main walls was practically levelled for a length of
four hundred yards, and four of the flanking towers were
destroyed. The broad ditch was filled in part by the
débris of the wall and in part by fascines. The Sultan
decided that the assault should take place on May 29th.
This became known to the Greeks in the city, and both
sides made every preparation for a supreme effort.</p>

<p>On the 28th, Mahomet ordered a proclamation to be
made to his troops, to the effect that when the city was
captured it would be given up to them to sack at their
will for three days. The Sultan, it said, had sworn by
the everlasting God, by the four thousand prophets, by
Mahomet, and by his own soul that the whole population
of the city, men, women, and children, should be given
over to them. This was received by the troops with
tumultuous expressions of delight.</p>

<p>On the same day the Sultan reviewed his army in
three divisions, each of fifty thousand men, and afterwards
received in his tent all the leaders, military and
naval. He made a speech to them in which he announced
his intention to make a final assault on the
city on the next day, explained to them the method
of attack, and gave his final orders. He enlarged on
his promise to give to the troops the plunder of the city.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the city [he said] there was an infinite amount and variety of wealth
of all kinds—treasure in the palaces and private houses, churches
abounding in furniture of silver, gold, and precious stones. All were
to be theirs. There were men of high rank and in great numbers who
could be captured and sold as slaves; there were great numbers of ladies
of noble families, young and beautiful, and a host of other women who
could either be sold or taken into their harems. There were boys of
good family. There were houses and beautiful gardens. “I give you
to-day a grand and populous city, the capital of the ancient Romans, the
very summit of splendour and of glory, which has become, so to say,
the centre of the world. I give it over to you to pillage, to seize its
incalculable treasure of men, women, and boys, and everything that
adorns it. You will henceforward live in great happiness and leave
great wealth to your children. The great gain to all the sons of Othman
would be the conquest of a city whose fame was great throughout the
world. The greater its renown, the greater would be the glory of taking
it by assault. A great city which had always been their enemy, which
had always looked upon them with a hostile eye, which in every way had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>sought to destroy the Turkish power, would come into their possession.
The door would be open to them by its capture to conquer the whole of
the Greek Empire.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We have quoted this speech of Mahomet as further proof
that plunder and the capture of men, women, and boys for
sale or for their harems, and not religious fanaticism, was
the main incentive to Moslem conquest.</p>

<p>The night before the assault was spent by the Turks in
rejoicing. Their camp was illuminated. Very different was
the action of the Greeks on this last day of their Empire.
There was a religious procession through the city, in which
every one whose presence was not required in defence of
the walls took part and joined in prayer, imploring God
not to allow them to fall into the hands of the enemy.
Eikons and relics were paraded. At the close of the
procession the Emperor Constantine addressed a gathering
of nobles and military leaders. He called attention to
the impending assault. He said:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It had always been held the duty of a citizen to be ready to die either
for his faith, his country, his sovereign, or his wife and children. All
these incentives to heroic sacrifice were now combined. The city was
the refuge for all Christians, the pride and joy of every Greek, and of all
who lived in Eastern lands. It was the Queen of Cities, the city which,
in happy times, had subdued nearly all the lands under the sun. The
enemy coveted it as his chief prize. He had provoked the war. He
had violated all his engagements in order to obtain it. He wished to put
the citizens under his yoke, to take them as slaves, to convert the holy
churches, where the divine Trinity was adored and the most holy
Godhead worshipped, into shrines for his blasphemy, and to put the false
prophet in the place of Christ. As brothers and fellow-soldiers it was
their duty to fight bravely in the defence of all that was dear to them, to
remember that they were the descendants of the heroes of ancient Greece
and Rome, and so conduct themselves that their memory should be as
fragrant in the future as that of their ancestors.... For himself, he was
determined to die in its defence.... He and they should put their trust
in God, and not, as did their enemy, in the multitude of his hordes.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the evening a solemn service was held at St. Sophia,
memorable as the last Christian service before its conversion
into a Turkish mosque. The Emperor and his
followers partook of the Sacrament and bade farewell to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>the Greek Patriarch. It was a memorable scene—a
requiem service for the Empire which was about to
expire. Later the Emperor paid a last visit to his palace
and bade farewell there to its staff. It was a most
touching occasion. One who was present there wrote of
it: “If a man had been made of wood or stone, he must
have wept at the scene.” It is very certain that the
Emperor had no hope of saving the city from capture by
its mortal foes.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning of the next fateful day,
the 29th May, 1453, the final assault was delivered by the
Turkish army. The scheme of the Sultan was to attack the
walls of the city at many points, from both land and sea,
but to make the main assault on the part of the wall which
had been so much injured by the cannon in the Lycus
Valley, near the gate of St. Romanus, and then, by successive
waves of his vastly greater army, to overwhelm
the defenders, using first his inferior troops, and reserving
his best for the last attack, when the enemy would be
wearied by long fighting. The first assault was made
by an immense horde of irregulars, armed with bows and
arrows, and with slings throwing stones and iron balls.
Gunpowder, though already used for cannon, was not yet
applied to muskets. The men advanced with scaling-ladders
for the assault, and a cloud of arrows darkened
the sky. No more than two thousand Greeks could be
spared to defend this part of the long line of fortifications.
They were collected in the <i>peribolus</i> between the
two walls. The gates in the inner wall were closed, so that
these men had no opportunity of shirking the defence and
retreating into the city. They had to fight for their very
lives between the two walls.</p>

<p>The Sultan directed the great cannon to be brought
to the edge of the fosse, and a shot from it broke down
the stockade which had been erected in place of the
outer wall. Under cover of the dust the Turks made
the assault. They were bravely met by the defenders,
and were driven back with heavy loss. A second assault
was then made by the Anatolian infantry, a very superior
force to the irregulars. But they were no more successful.
The Sultan, thinking that the Greeks must be exhausted
by these two assaults, then personally led a third great
body of men to a third assault. It consisted of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Janissaries. He led them to the edge of the fosse, and
thence directed their attack. The cannon was used again
against the stockade, and again under cover of the dust
caused by it the Janissaries made their assault. Some of
them succeeded in getting over the stockade, and a hand-to-hand
fight occurred between them and the Greeks. The
defenders seemed to have the best of it. But at this crisis
a grave misfortune occurred to the Greeks. Giustiniani,
who commanded them, was severely wounded. Blood
flowed freely from his wounds. He decided to leave the
field of battle and return to his ship in the harbour, for
medical relief. The Emperor Constantine, who was near
by, in vain implored him to remain, pointing out to him
the damaging effect his departure would have on the
soldiers who remained. Others thought that the wounds
were not very serious and that the general was not justified
in leaving the field. But he insisted on doing so, and
demanded the key of the gate in the inner wall. With
him departed some of his Genoese soldiers. This defection
caused dismay and depression among the troops. Their
resistance to the Turks slackened.</p>

<p>Some Greek historians accuse Giustiniani of cowardice
in deserting the battle at so critical a moment, and Gibbon
lends the weight of his great authority to this. The reputation,
however, of the famous Italian soldier has been vindicated
by later historians, such as Mr. Finlay and Sir
Edwin Pears. They have shown that Giustiniani died of
his wounds within a few days of the capture of Constantinople,
the best proof of their serious and fatal character.
All the same, he may not have sufficiently appreciated the
effect of his withdrawal on the soldiers. It might have
been better to have died there rather than on board his
ship. However that might have been, all are agreed that
the departure of the general was the turning-point of the
day, and that it had the worst effect on the soldiers engaged
in the defence.</p>

<p>The Emperor did his utmost to retrieve the position.
He took upon himself the charge vacated by Giustiniani,
and led the defence. Mahomet, on his part, had observed
from the other side of the fosse the slackening of the
defence. He called out to the Janissaries: “We have
the city! It is ours! The wall is undefended!” He
urged them to a final effort. They rushed the stockade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
and effected an entry into the <i>peribolus</i>. Soon great swarms
of others followed, and overwhelmed the defenders with
their vast numbers. The Emperor, despairing of success,
threw aside his imperial mantle. He called out, “The
city is taken and I am still alive!” Drawing his sword,
he threw himself into the mêlée. He died fighting
gloriously for his city and his Empire. His body was
never found, though search was made for it by order of
the Sultan. The Greek and Italian soldiers in the <i>peribolus</i>
were now completely outnumbered. There was no exit
through the inner wall by which they could escape. They
were in a trap between the two walls. They were
massacred to a man. The Janissaries, having effected this,
found no difficulty in making their way through the inner
wall, which, as we have explained, was not defended owing
to the want of men.</p>

<p>All attacks on other parts of the city were failures.
This one alone succeeded. Victory here was due in part
to the good generalship of Mahomet and to his indomitable
persistency, and in part to the ill-fortune of the Greeks
in the withdrawal of Giustiniani at the critical moment of
the defence. The defenders of the city had nobly performed
their duty. Their numbers were quite insufficient.
They had received no adequate support from Western
Europe, or even from the neighbouring Christian States.
It is quite certain that a few thousand more soldiers would
have saved the city. Thirty galleys sent by the Pope
with reinforcements were on their way when the city
fell. They had been detained at Scio by adverse wind.
“Auxilium deus ipse negavit,” says the Greek historian.</p>

<p>When the Turks entered the city they began to massacre
all the persons they met in the streets, without distinction
of age or sex. But there was practically no resistance.
There were no armed men left in the city. The population
was cowed and panic-stricken, as well they might
be in face of the overwhelming misfortune which now
came upon them. After a short period of massacre the
Turks turned their attention to the more practical business
of looting and taking captives for sale. They effected
this in a deliberate and systematic way. One great band
of soldiers devoted themselves to plundering the palaces of
the wealthy, another to the churches, and a third to
the shops and smaller houses. Everything of value was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
gathered together for subsequent division among the
soldiers. Of the inmates of the palaces and houses the
older people were put to death; the stronger and younger
of both sexes were carried off in bands as prisoners, bound
together with ropes, with a view to ultimate sale as slaves.</p>

<p>The Turkish historian, Seadeddin, in words which seem
to smack of pleasure at the scene, says:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Having received permission to loot, the soldiers thronged into the city
with joyous hearts, and there, seizing the possessors and their families, they
made the wretched unbelievers weep. They acted in accordance with
the precept, “Slaughter their aged and capture their youth.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The gravest misfortunes fell upon the wealthier and
more cultured classes in the city. Their daughters and
sons were torn from them to be sold to harems in Asia
Minor, or for other vile purposes. The parents, if still
strong, were sold as slaves. Numbers of them fled from
their houses and crowded into St. Sophia and other churches,
hoping that their foes would respect places of worship,
or expecting that a miracle of some kind would save
them. But it was in vain. St. Sophia acted as a kind
of drag-net in which all the best in the city were collected,
and were carried off thence in gangs. Virgins consecrated
to God were dragged from this and other churches by their
hair and were ruthlessly stripped of every ornament they
possessed. A horde of savage brutes committed unnameable
barbarities.</p>

<p>The city was cleared of everything of value and was all
but denuded of its population. By the lowest estimate,
fifty thousand persons, mostly the strong and the young
of both sexes, were made captives, and later were sold
as slaves and deported to Asia Minor. Some few escaped
from the city into the country districts. Others found
refuge in the Greek and Genoese galleys in the harbour,
which were able to get away and escape because the
crews of the Turkish vessels blockading the port had
deserted in order to take part in the sack. Some were
able to hide themselves in the city, and emerged later
when the scene of horrors was at an end. Others, we
know not how many, were ruthlessly massacred because
they were of no value for sale. The proceeds of the sack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>and of the sale of captives brought wealth to every soldier
in the Turkish army. No such dire misfortune to a
city had occurred since the destruction of Carthage.</p>

<p>After three days and nights of these orgies the Sultan
intervened and proclaimed an end of them. Meanwhile, on
the day of the last assault, when his troops were in possession
of the city, the Sultan rode into it. He went direct to
St. Sophia, and, dismounting, entered the great church. He
took pains at once to prevent any destruction of its contents,
and himself struck down a soldier engaged in this
work, telling him that buildings were reserved for himself.
He instructed a mollah to call people to prayer
from the pulpit. He thus inaugurated the conversion of
the splendid Christian church into a mosque.</p>

<p>After this he sent for Notaras, who had been in command
of the Greek forces under the Emperor, and affected to
treat him with generosity. He obtained a list of all the
leading men in the city and offered a large reward for
their heads.</p>

<p>On the next day the Sultan made an inspection of the
city and paid a visit to the Imperial Palace. On entering
it he quoted the lines from a Persian poet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The spider’s web hangs before the portal of Cæsar’s palace,</div>
<div class="line">The owl is the sentinel on the watch-tower.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Later he presided at a great banquet, where he appears
to have imbibed too freely of wine. When half-drunk
he directed the chief eunuch to go to Notaras and demand
of him his youngest son, a handsome lad of fourteen.
Notaras refused, preferring death to dishonour for his son.
The Sultan thereupon ordered Notaras and all his family
to be put to death at once. Their heads were struck off
and brought to the banquet and placed before the Sultan
as a decoration of his table.</p>

<p>It was said that the Sultan’s ferocity was stimulated
by the last favourite of his harem, with whom he was
much enamoured, and that she, on her part, was instigated
by her father, a Greek renegade. Under this influence
the Sultan ordered the execution of all the persons to whom
on the previous day he had promised liberty. The Papal
legate, Cardinal Isidore, escaped recognition and was sold
as a slave by a soldier for a mean price. He was later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
ransomed. Orkhan, the grandson of Bayezid, who had
been brought up as a Christian at the Imperial Court,
committed suicide rather than be sold as a slave.</p>

<p>Although many cruel deeds were committed by the
Sultan and his soldiers, and a terrible calamity fell upon
the whole community of Greeks, it cannot be said that
the capture of Constantinople was the scene of such
infamous orgies as took place in 1204, when it was
captured by the Crusaders. After the first few hours of
entry there was on this occasion no general massacre.
There was not much incendiarism. The Sultan did his
best, successfully, to save the churches and other buildings.</p>

<p>Although the young Sultan was most brutal in some of
his actions, he showed in others remarkable foresight and
statesmanship. One of his earliest acts, after putting an
end to the sack of the city, was to proclaim himself as
protector of the Greek Church. A charter was granted
to the Orthodox members of that Church securing to
the use of it some of the churches in the capital, and
authority to celebrate in them religious rites according to
their ancient usage. It also gave to them a certain amount
of autonomy in civil matters. It recognized their laws of
marriage and of succession to property and gave jurisdiction
to the Patriarch and to Ecclesiastical Courts to enforce
them.</p>

<p>The most eminent survivor of the Greek clergy,
Gennadius, was sought for. He had been sold as a slave
after the sack of the city to a pasha at Adrianople. He
was brought back to Constantinople and was invested by
the Sultan with the office of Patriarch of the Greek Church.
Mahomet, in doing so, said: “I appoint you Patriarch.
May Heaven protect you. In all cases and all occasions
count on my friendship and enjoy in peace all the privileges
of your predecessors.” This was a most wise and
opportune act of policy. The Sultan had been advised
by fanatics among the Turks to order a general massacre
of Greeks and others who would not embrace Islam.
Mahomet’s record shows that he would have sanctioned
this if he had thought it for the interest of the State, and
he would probably have revelled in it. In pursuance of
a deliberate policy of enlightened statecraft he rejected
this advice. It was necessary to repeople his capital and
to attract others than Turks to it. Mahomet was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
ambitious of further conquests in Europe. He recognized
that the attempt to force a wholesale change of religion
on the vanquished would stimulate their resistance, while
a wise tolerance might weaken it. When the Prince of
Serbia asked Hunyadi, the Hungarian patriot, what he would
do with the Orthodox Greek Church if he made himself
master of that province, the reply was, “I will establish
everywhere Catholic churches.” The reply of Mahomet
to a similar question was, “By the side of every mosque
a church shall be erected in which your people will be
able to pray.”</p>

<p>This great act of tolerance of Mahomet was far ahead
of the political ethics of the Christian Powers of Europe at
that time. His example was not followed by the Spaniards,
when they drove from their country the Moslem Moors,
who had refused to adopt the religion of their victors.
The action of Mahomet is another proof that the Turkish
invasion of Europe was not actuated by religious fanaticism
or the desire to spread Islam. There seems to have been
no attempt to induce or compel the Greeks and others of
the conquered city to embrace Islam.</p>

<p>Mahomet also set to work, at an early date, to repeople
Constantinople. For a long time previous to the conquest
its population had been dwindling. In proportion as
the Greek Empire was reduced by the loss of its territories,
so the importance of the capital was diminished. Mahomet
invited all who had fled after the capture to return,
promising protection to their property and religion. He
directed the transfer of families of Greeks, Jews, and Turks
from many parts of his Empire. When he took possession
of Trebizond and the Morea, many thousands of
Greeks were forcibly removed to Constantinople. The same
was the case with many islands in the Ægean Sea. At
the end of his reign Constantinople was far more populous
and flourishing than it had been under the last Greek
Emperor.</p>

<p>Although the capture of Constantinople was the principal
feat in Mahomet’s long reign, and that on which his fame
in history chiefly rests, it was, in fact, only the first of a
long list of conquests which earned for him from his countrymen
the title <i>par éminence</i> of ‘the Conqueror.’ During
the thirty years of his reign he was almost always at war
in personal command of his armies, and there were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
few in which he did not add fresh territory to his Empire,
either in Europe or Asia.</p>

<p>Bosnia and the Morea, which had become tributary States
under previous Sultans, were now again invaded and were
compelled to become integral parts of the Empire. Their
princes were dethroned and put to death. Wallachia and
the Crimea were forced to become vassal States. In Asia,
Karamania, so long the rival and foe of the Ottomans, and
which, after many wars, had agreed to pay tribute, was
now forcibly annexed, and its Seljukian line of kings was
put an end to by death. The great city of Trebizond and
its adjoining province of Cappadocia, which had been cut
off from the parent Empire, after the capture of Constantinople
by the Crusaders, and formed into a miniature
Empire, under the Comneni dynasty, was invaded and
annexed by Mahomet, and at his instance its reigning family
was put to death. The possessions of the Genoese on the
coasts of the Black Sea were seized and appropriated.</p>

<p>Many islands in the Greek Archipelago, including Lesbos,
Lemnos, and Cephalonia, were also attacked and annexed.
The same fate befell Eubœa. It belonged to the Republic
of Venice, which was also deprived of others of its possessions
on the coast of the Morea. Besides all these enterprises,
Mahomet in several successive years sent armies to
ravage parts of Styria and Transylvania. He even sent an
army across the frontier of Italy to ravage the region of
Friuli, and other districts almost within sight of Venice,
whose Republic was compelled to enter into an ignominious
treaty, binding it to assist the Ottomans in other wars with a
naval force. The last achievement of the ambitious Sultan
was to send a force to the South of Italy, where it captured
Otranto. The only captures which Mahomet attempted without
success were those of Belgrade, in 1456, and the
island of Rhodes in 1480. The case of Belgrade was
of the greatest importance, for it long barred the way to
the invasion of Hungary and Germany. The Sultan himself
took command of the army of attack with a hundred
and fifty thousand men and three hundred guns. He thought
the capture of it would be an easy task after that of
Constantinople. But Western Europe, which had rendered
so little assistance to the Greek Empire in its extremities,
was alarmed at the prospect of the invasion of Germany
through the loss of Belgrade. The Pope preached another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
crusade, and a large body of knights volunteered for the
defence of this frontier city.</p>

<p>Hunyadi led the Hungarians in this his last campaign.
The lower town was taken by the Turks after great loss
of life; but the upper town made a protracted resistance.
The Christian knights in a notable sortie attacked the
batteries of the enemy, captured all the guns, and wounded
the Sultan himself. Mahomet was compelled to raise the
siege after losing fifty thousand men. It was the last feat
of the Hungarian patriot. He died twenty days after this
signal success. It was fifty years before Belgrade was
again attacked and captured and the road was opened for
the invasion of Hungary and Vienna.</p>

<p>In all these campaigns Mahomet personally led his armies
in the field, with the exception of those for the invasion
of the Crimea, the attack on Rhodes, and the capture
of Otranto, where he delegated the task to able generals, of
whom he appears to have had an abundant supply. But there
never was a great commander who more completely dominated
the generals under him and maintained his supremacy
in the State. He made no confidences as to his intended
military operations, or what were his immediate objects
of attack. There were no councils of war. His armies
were collected, year after year, on one side or other of
the Bosphorus, without any one knowing their destination.
When, on one occasion, one of his generals asked him
what was his next object, he replied that if a single hair
of his beard knew what his intentions were he would
pluck it out and cast it into the fire. He held secrecy and
rapidity to be the first elements of success in war, and he
acted on this principle. With the exception of the single
case of the invasion of Wallachia, the provocation for war
was in every case on the part of the Sultan. Invasion
and attack were preceded by laconic messages calling upon
the State or city aimed at to surrender, and the actual
attack was made with the shortest possible delay.</p>

<p>Having determined on war and invasion, his object was
pursued with the utmost vigour, and wholly regardless of
the loss of life. As a rule, his campaigns were short;
but the war with Venice was an exception. It lasted for
many years. It consisted mainly of attacks on strongholds
of the Republic in the islands of the Archipelago
and the coasts of Greece and Albania, where the fleets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of the two Powers played a large part. The conquest of
Albania also was only effected after a struggle spread
over many years, in which the patriot hero, Scanderbeg,
defeated successive attacks by Ottoman armies enormously
exceeding his native levies. It was not till after the death
of this great chief, in 1467, that Mahomet was able to
wear down opposition in Albania by sheer force of numbers.</p>

<p>Early in his reign Mahomet recognized the strategic
value of Constantinople. It became the keystone of his
Empire. He transferred the seat of his government to it
from Adrianople. He fortified the Dardanelles by the
erection of two castles on either side of it near to Sestos
and Abydos, each with thirty guns, which commanded
the Straits. This secured his capital from attack. It
prevented the entrance of a hostile fleet into the Sea of
Marmora and the Black Sea. He added greatly to his
navy, and made it superior to that of any other single
Power in the Mediterranean. It gave him absolute supremacy
in the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmora. The
possessions of the Genoese in the Black Sea were at his
mercy. He sent a flotilla of small vessels up the Danube
to assist in the siege of Belgrade.</p>

<p>Throughout all his campaigns Mahomet exhibited perfidy
and cruelty on a scale almost without precedent. Princes,
generals, and armies, who capitulated on the promises of
safety of life and respect of property, were put to death
without compunction, in gross breach of faith. The inhabitants
of cities were sold into slavery or transferred
forcibly to Turkish dominions, in total disregard of solemn
pledges.</p>

<p>A notable case of this kind was that of Bosnia, where
the final victory was achieved by the Ottoman Grand Vizier,
in command of one of the armies engaged, under the
supreme command of the Sultan. The Prince of Bosnia
and his army capitulated on the distinct engagement in
writing that their lives would be spared. Mahomet was
full of wrath at this concession. It was his deliberate
policy to extinguish by death the family of any reigning
prince whom he vanquished in war. He consulted on
the point the Mufti, with doubtless a strong hint as to
what the answer should be. The Mufti issued a <i>fetva</i>
which declared that no treaty of this kind with an infidel
was binding on the Sultan. The holy man went so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
as to offer himself to act as executioner. When the
Bosnian king was summoned to the presence of the Sultan,
and came before him trembling, with the treaty of capitulation
in his hand, the Mufti himself struck off his head in
the presence of the Sultan, exclaiming that it was a good
deed to put an end to an infidel. The <i>fetva</i> in this case
formed a precedent for numerous similar cases. The whole
of the royal family of Comnenus, the Emperor of Trebizond,
who, without a fight, surrendered his kingdom to
Mahomet, upon the promise of life and private property to
himself and his family, were put to death a few weeks
later in Constantinople on the most flimsy pretence.</p>

<p>In a similar way, when the island of Eubœa was captured
from the Venetians in 1470 by the Sultan, the Venetian
garrison, supported by the Greek population, made a most
gallant defence and inflicted enormous losses on the Turks.
Paul Evizzo, the Venetian general in command of the island,
eventually surrendered on the promise of safety of life to
himself and his army. Mahomet broke his word. He
put to death the whole of the Venetian garrison by the
cruel method of impaling. The gallant Evizzo was, by
the Sultan’s order, sawn in two. His daughter was summoned
to Mahomet’s tent, and when she refused to submit
to his lust, was put to death by his order. The island was
added to the Ottoman Empire in 1471.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that in all these conquests the
Ottoman armies were very greatly superior in number and
in armaments. In many cases they were also assisted
by the disunion of their opponents. The subjection of
Karamania was due to the death of its last king, Ibrahim,
who left seven sons behind him. Six of them were sons
of a wife of royal descent, the seventh the son of a slave.
The father favoured the youngest, whom he declared his
heir. The other six fought for their patrimony against the
youngest and besieged him in Konia, the capital. Mahomet
thought that this was a good opportunity to intervene
and to annex the whole country. Without any cause
of quarrel he marched an army of a hundred thousand
men into the country and waged war against all the sons.
The Grand Vizier, Mahmoud Pasha, was sent on in advance,
and defeated Ishak, the youngest son of Ibrahim, in front
of Konia. The terms of capitulation were thought by
Mahomet to be too humane. He determined to punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mahmoud for his leniency. The cords of his tent were
cut while the Vizier was asleep. The tent fell on the
luckless sleeper. This was a sign of disgrace. Mahmoud,
who was a most able and successful general and statesman,
was removed from his post and was put to death. The
Karamanian dynasty, which for so long had been the
rival of that of Othman, was now completely subdued.
The country became a province of the Turkish Empire.
Its two principal cities were depopulated and lost their
splendour. It never again gave trouble to the Ottoman
government.</p>

<p>The country which suffered most from the cruelties of
Mahomet was Greece. Here, again, disunion was the main
cause of its ruin. Two brothers of Constantine, the last
Greek Emperor at Constantinople, Demetrius and Thomas,
held sway as tributaries of the Sultan, the one at
Argos, the other at Patras. Unmindful of the danger
which threatened them, they fought one another for supremacy,
after the death of Constantine, and were assisted
in their internecine war by large numbers of turbulent
Albanians, who transferred their services, now to one and
now to another of these petty despots, and are said to
have changed sides three times in the course of a single
Sunday. Mahomet, in 1458, thinking that the disputes
between the two brothers afforded a good occasion for
getting full possession of the Morea, invaded it with a
large force. The two brothers, instead of uniting to defend
the country, continued to fight against one another, and
attempted, at the same time, singly to fight against the
Turks. There followed scenes of massacre and rapine
as Mahomet’s army passed through the country, besieging
and capturing successively its many petty strongholds. In
nearly every case, after vigorous resistance, capitulation
was offered and agreed to on promise of life to the
garrisons. In no case was the promise kept. As a rule,
the fighting-men were massacred after surrender, their
leaders were sawn in two, and the other inhabitants were sold
into slavery, or were in some cases transferred <i>en masse</i>
to Constantinople as colonists to fill the empty city. The
two brothers were driven from the country. Demetrius
appears to have made some kind of terms with the Sultan,
one of which was that his daughter should enter Mahomet’s
harem. This promise was not kept; she was not thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
worthy of it, and she was insulted by being deprived of
the only eunuch who attended her. It is not stated what
became of her. Thomas fled from the country, carrying
with him, instead of treasure, a valuable relic, the head
of St. Andrew, with which he disappeared from history.
The Sultan possessed himself of the whole country, with
the exception of two or three seaports in the hands of the
Venetians. The memory of this cruel invasion of the
Turks was deeply impressed on the minds of the people
of Greece. But for 471 years, with a short interlude
when it was held by the Venetians, it remained a Turkish
province.</p>

<p>On his way back to Constantinople the Sultan passed
by Athens, where one Franco reigned as Duke, but
tributary to the Turks. He gave orders that Franco was
to be strangled. As a special favour this operation was
effected, not in the tent of the Turkish general, but in
his own domicile, and thus the last spark of Greek
independence passed away.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps fair to judge of Mahomet as regards
his cruelties and perfidies by a high standard. His
opponents, the chiefs of the countries he invaded and
conquered, were, in many cases, not inferior to him
in these respects. Scanderbeg, whose patriotic defence
of Albania won for him the reputation of a saint in his
own country, and a high place in history, was most cruel
and vindictive whenever he had the opportunity. He
habitually massacred the prisoners taken in his battles.
The two despots of the Morea were not behindhand in
this respect. The Prince, or Voivode as he was called,
of Wallachia, Wlad by name, was one of the most cruel
and bloodthirsty ruffians recorded in history. He was
known by the name of “the Impaler.” He revelled in
the dying agonies of the prisoners and other victims whom
he subjected to this cruel death. They were reserved
for this purpose to enliven his banquets. When some
guest expressed surprise that he could bear the odour
emanating from the victims of this death, the prince
directed the immediate execution of his guest, on a
higher pale than the others, so that he might not be
incommoded by the odour he complained of.</p>

<p>Mahomet invaded Wallachia, in 1462, with an army of
two hundred thousand. In his pursuit of Wlad he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
across a field where twenty thousand Turks and Bulgarians
had been put to death, one-half of them by impalement and
the other half by crucifixion. Mahomet defeated and drove
into exile this ruffian, and installed in his place a favourite
named Radul, who had been brought up at his Court
as a page. On the death of this man Wlad turned up
again, but was killed by a slave. Wallachia, which
previously had been compelled to pay tribute by Mahomet,
was now made a vassal State. The Sultan appointed its
prince. It was not otherwise treated as a Turkish province.</p>

<p>The failure of the Turkish general to capture the island
of Rhodes was said to be due to the fact that, just before
the final assault, after long resistance by the Knights who
held this island, the Turkish general issued an order to
the army that there was to be no pillage of the city,
wishing to reserve for the Sultan and himself the wealth
which might be captured. This dispirited the Turkish
soldiers, and they made no effort for success in the assault.
The Knights again repulsed the attack and the siege was
raised. It was not till 1520 that Rhodes was finally
captured.</p>

<p>Great as Mahomet was as a warrior and general, he
was not less conspicuous as an administrator and statesman.
The organization and provisioning of his armies
in his numerous campaigns were specially worthy of notice.
His soldiers were always well fed and were amply equipped
with guns and armaments. He was also the sole source of
legislation for his Empire. He had supreme power over life
and property of all his subjects. More than any of his predecessors
and successors, he founded mosques, hospitals,
colleges, and schools in Constantinople and other cities of
his Empire. He fully recognized the importance of science
in education. He cultivated the society of learned men
and loved to converse with them. He had some reputation
as a poet. With all this, he was notorious for evil and
sensual life in a direction which is held to be infamous
and degrading by all peoples. He was not only himself
guilty of fratricide, but he prescribed it as a family law for
his successors. He died at the age of fifty-one, after thirty
years of reign. He had collected a great army for another
campaign, but no one knew what his aims and intentions
were, whether for another attack on Rhodes, or for the
invasion of Candia, or to follow up his success in Calabria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
His secret died with him. He was the first Sultan to be
buried at Constantinople, in the famous mosque which he
built there. In spite of his cruelties and perfidies and
of his evil life, he has been held in honour by successive
generations of his countrymen, and has been rightly
designated as ‘the Conqueror.’</p>

<h2><small>VIII</small><br /><br />

BAYEZID II<br />

<small>1481-1512</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mahomet</span> left two sons, of whom the eldest, Bayezid, succeeded
him as Sultan at the age of thirty-five. Von Hammer
and other historians, who have founded their narratives on
his great work, write of Bayezid in terms of disparagement
because, unlike other early Sultans of the Othman race, he
did not signalize his reign by any great additions to his
Empire. If success as a ruler is only to be measured by
territorial expansion, Bayezid must take rank in history
below the other nine Sultans who created the Ottoman
Empire and raised it to its zenith. A great Empire, however,
such as that which the Ottomans had already achieved,
may be better served by peace than by war for further
conquests. It would certainly have been well for the Ottomans
if no attempt had ever been made to extend their
Empire northwards beyond the Danube. Bayezid, so far
as we can gather his policy from his actual deeds, was not
favourable to expansion of his Empire. If he was engaged
for some years in war with Hungary, Venice, and Egypt,
he was not the aggressor. He came to terms of peace with
these Powers when it was possible to do so. He did not
support the army which, under his predecessor, had invaded
Italy and captured Otranto. He recalled the very able
general, Ahmed Keduk, who commanded it. Khaireddin
Pasha, who succeeded in command, after a most gallant
defence, was compelled to capitulate; and never again was
Italy invaded by a Turkish army. It would seem to have
been a wise decision on the part of Bayezid not to pursue
further the Italian adventure.</p>

<p>As it is not our intention to write a complete history of
the Ottoman Sultans, but rather to describe the early expan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>sion
of their Empire and its later dismemberment, it will not
be necessary to devote more than a very few pages to the
comparatively uneventful reign of Bayezid. It may be well,
however, briefly to note that he was of philosophic temperament,
very austere in religion, and without his father’s vices.
Like many of his race he was devoted to literary studies,
and he had a reputation as a poet. He was not wanting in
energy and valour when occasion required. He was,
however, the first of his race who did not habitually lead
his armies into the field.</p>

<p>His younger brother Djem, who at the death of Mahomet
was only twenty-two years of age, was a much more fiery,
valorous, and ambitious soldier, and of more attractive
personality. He was of a romantic disposition, and had
a much greater reputation than Bayezid as a poet. His
poems rank high in Turkish literature. His strange
adventures and sad fate form one of the romances of Turkish
history, which might well fill many chapters. It must
suffice to record of him that, like other brothers of Sultans
who were not at once put to death at the commencement
of a new reign, he took up arms and claimed the throne
against Bayezid. The latter fortunately was the first to
arrive at Constantinople after the death of Mahomet. He
there obtained the support of the Janissaries, not without
large presents to them. With the aid of Ahmed Keduk,
Bayezid, after vain efforts to come to terms with his
brother, was successful in putting down two rebellions of
a formidable character on behalf of Djem. After the
second defeat Djem fled to Egypt, and thence, after many
adventures, found his way to the island of Rhodes, where
he claimed the hospitality of the Knights of Jerusalem.
Their Grand Master, D’Aubusson, who had made such a
gallant defence of the island against Mahomet, and who
was a most brave warrior, was also a crafty and perfidious
intriguer. On the one hand, he induced Prince Djem to
enter into a treaty, by which very important concessions
were promised to the knights in the event of Djem being
able to gain the Ottoman throne. On the other hand,
D’Aubusson negotiated a treaty with Bayezid under which
he was to receive an allowance of 45,000 ducats a year,
nominally for the maintenance of Djem, but really as an inducement
to prevent the escape of that prince from Rhodes.
On the strength of this, the unfortunate prince was detained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
as a virtual prisoner in Rhodes, and later in a castle at
Sasesnage, in France, belonging to the order of the Knights,
for not less than seven years. At the end of this time the
King of France, Charles VIII, intervened in favour of the
prince, and got him transferred into the keeping of the
Pope at Rome. The Pope Callixtus was also not above
making a good profit out of Djem. He came to terms
with Sultan Bayezid under which he was to pocket the
45,000 ducats a year so long as Djem was kept out of
mischief. On the death, some years later, of this Pope, his
successor, Pope Alexander Borgia, of infamous memory,
renewed the treaty with Sultan Bayezid, with the addition of
a clause that he was to receive a lump sum of 300,000
ducats if Prince Djem, instead of being detained as
prisoner, was put to death. After a short interval the
Pope, fearing the intervention of the King of France, on
behalf of Djem, and wishing to pocket the lump sum, contrived
the death by poison of the prince. The menace to the
Sultan was thus at last removed, and his Empire was
spared another civil war, at a cost which by the ethics of
the day was no doubt fully justified.</p>

<p>Of other incidents in Bayezid’s reign it is only necessary
to state that the most important of his achievements was
the complete subjection, in the second year of his reign, of
Herzegovina, which had been a tributary State under his
predecessors, but was now again invaded. It was finally
incorporated as a province of the Empire. There were
also many years of desultory war with Hungary, in which
frequent raids were made by the two Powers upon one
another’s territories, and where each vied with the other
in atrocious cruelties. Everywhere children were impaled,
young women were violated in presence of their parents,
wives in presence of their husbands, and thousands of
captives were carried off and sold into slavery. But there
were no other results, and peace was eventually established
between the two Powers.</p>

<p>In Asia there was war for five years with the Mameluke
government of Egypt and Syria. The Mamelukes had sent
an army in support of an insurrection in Karamania. The
outbreak was put down, and the Karamanians were finally
subjected, but the Mamelukes defeated the Turkish armies
in three great battles. Peace was eventually made, but
only on concession by the Turks of three important fortresses
in Asia Minor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>There was also war with the Republic of Venice, in the
course of which the Turks succeeded in capturing the
three remaining Venetian fortresses in the Morea—Navarino,
Modon, and Coron—an important success which extinguished
the influence of Venice on the coasts of Greece. The
success was largely due to a great increase of the Turkish
navy, which in Mahomet’s reign had achieved a supremacy
in the Mediterranean over any other single naval Power.
It now defeated the Venetian fleet in a desperate battle off
Lepanto in 1499, and met on equal terms the combined
fleets of Venice, Austria, and the Pope in 1500. It also
went farther afield, and at the entreaty of the Moors of
Grenada, who were severely pressed by the Christian army
in Spain, ravaged the coasts of that country.</p>

<p>The last two years of Bayezid’s fairly prosperous reign
were obscured by another civil war, this time at the instance
of his son and successor, Selim. Selim was the youngest
of three surviving sons of Bayezid. All three had been
invested with important posts as governors of provinces
in Asia. Ahmed, the second of them, was the favourite of
his father, who designated him for succession to the throne.
But Selim was by far the ablest and most daring of them.
He determined to anticipate the death of his father, who
was ageing and in feeble health, by securing the throne for
himself. Leaving his seat of government with a large suite,
almost amounting to an army, he paid a visit, uninvited,
to his father at Constantinople, and there fomented intrigues.
He was the idol of the Janissaries, who were dissatisfied with
the long inaction of Sultan Bayezid, and hoped for new
conquests and loot under Selim. Bayezid, however, was
supported for the time by a section of his army, and succeeded
in defeating his son. Selim then fled to the Crimea,
where he raised a new army and, later, again made his way
to Constantinople by a forced march round the north of
the Black Sea. On arriving there he was supported by the
full force of the Turkish army.</p>

<p>The Janissaries, at the instance of Selim, stormed at
the gates of the imperial palace and insisted on the
Sultan receiving them in person. Bayezid gave way
and admitted a deputation of them to an audience.
Seated on his throne, he asked them what they wanted.
“Our Padishah,” they said, “is old and sickly; we
will that Selim shall be Sultan.” Bayezid, finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
that he could not rely on any section of his army,
submitted. “I abdicate,” he said, “in favour of my son,
Selim. May God grant him a prosperous reign.” He
only asked as a favour that he might be allowed to retire
to the city of Asia Minor where he was born. His son
thereupon conducted his father, the ex-Sultan, to the outskirts
of the city with every mark of respect, and Bayezid
departed on his journey. He died, however, three days
later, not without grave suspicion of foul play. The deposition
of Bayezid is interesting and important as showing the
increasing power of the Janissaries. Only the strongest
Sultan could thenceforth cope with them, and they became
eventually one of the main causes of the decay of the
Empire which they had done so much to call into existence.</p>

<p>Bayezid, like others of his race, in spite of his philosophic
temperament and his love of ease, had a vein of cruelty.
It has been shown that he caused his brother Djem to be
poisoned. This was in accord with the family law. A
more serious instance was that he put to death his great
general, Ahmed Keduk, to whom he was deeply indebted for
success in putting down the insurrection of Djem. Ahmed
had deeply offended the Sultan by brusquely opposing his
peaceful policy, and Bayezid forcibly removed the incautious
critic.</p>

<p>The net result to the Turkish Empire of the thirty-one
years of Bayezid’s reign was, on the one hand, the incorporation
of Herzegovina, and the expulsion of the Venetians
from the Morea; on the other, the loss of three fortresses
in Asia Minor to the Mamelukes of Egypt and the withdrawal
from the South of Italy.</p>

<p>An incident worth recording was the first appearance of
Russia in the field of Turkish diplomacy. An ambassador
was sent to Bayezid by Czar Ivan III. He was instructed
to refuse to bow his knee to the Sultan or to concede precedence
to any other ambassadors. Bayezid meekly gave
way on these points of etiquette. This was a presage of
the attitude of Russia which two centuries later threatened
the existence of the Turkish Empire.</p>

<h2><small>IX</small><br /><br />

SELIM I<br />

<small>1512-20</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the forced abdication of Bayezid, Selim was proclaimed
Sultan at Constantinople, with the full support of the
Janissaries. He reigned for only eight years, but he
succeeded in this short time in more than doubling the
extent of the Ottoman Empire. He made no additions
to it in Europe, but he conquered and annexed the great
provinces of Diarbekir and Khurdistan from Persia, and
Egypt, Syria, and a great part of Arabia, including the
holy cities, from the Mameluke government of Egypt. He
commenced this career of war and conquest at the ripe
age of forty-seven. He proved to be a ruler and general
of indomitable will and vigour, the exact opposite to his
father in his greed for expansion of his Empire. He
was a most able administrator. He cared little for his
harem or other pleasures of life. Sleeping but little, he
spent his nights in literary studies. He delighted in
theological discussions and in the society of learned men,
and he appointed them to high offices in the State. They
had no effect, however, in softening his evil nature. He
had no regard for human life, whether in war or in peace.
He was attended by men called mutes, who were ready
at any moment to strangle or decapitate on the spot any
person designated by him. His most trusted counsellors,
his oldest friends and associates, were in constant danger
of life. He met argument or protest against his schemes,
or criticism of his past actions, by instant death, not unfrequently
by his own hand. During his short reign seven
of his Grand Viziers were decapitated by his orders.
Numerous other officials and generals shared the same
fate. They seldom enjoyed the sweets of office for more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
than a few months. One of them, in playful reminder of
this to Selim, asked to be given a short notice of his
doom, so that he might put his private affairs in order.
The Sultan replied to him: “I have been thinking for
some time of having thee killed, but I have at present
no one to fill thy place, otherwise I would willingly oblige
thee.” Judges convicted of corruption were dealt with
in the same way. By a malicious irony they were compelled
to pass sentence on themselves, before being handed over
to the executioner. Janissaries who dared to ask for an
increase of pay were also condemned to death. The first
recorded act of Selim’s reign was to strike dead with
his own sword a Janissary who was deputed by the corps
to ask for the accustomed presents on his accession. It
does not appear that these events cast gloom on Selim’s
Court. They soon lost the sense of novelty. There were
plenty of applicants for the vacant posts, willing and eager
to run the risks of office. Selim was agreeable in his
conversation and life was gay. He did not indulge in
refinements of cruelty like his grandfather Mahomet. He
acted from a sense of public duty. If he spilled much
blood, he restored and maintained discipline in the army
and stemmed the course of corruption. He was distinctly
popular with his subjects, with whom, as in most Eastern
countries, affection was in part inspired by terror.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, Selim’s two elder brothers,
Khorkand and Ahmed, whose claims to the Sultanate had
been set aside, and who were at the head of important
governments in Asia Minor, took up arms against him.
Selim, without loss of a moment, led an army to Brusa
against them. Khorkand, taken unawares, was quickly defeated.
He was allowed an hour’s respite before being
bow-strung. During this short interval he wrote a poem
deprecating his brother’s cruelty. Selim wept over the
poem and ordered a State funeral for his brother. At
Brusa a horrible scene of slaughter took place. Five
nephews of Selim—possible claimants to the throne—were
collected there. They were of varying ages, from five
to twenty. They were all strangled by order of the Sultan—the
eldest of them resisting with terrible struggles, the
youngest with plaintive cries for mercy, while Selim from
an adjoining room was a witness of the scene, and urged
his mutes to hasten their task. Ahmed, the second and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
favourite son of Bayezid, made a longer resistance in the
field, but a few months later he was defeated and put
to death.</p>

<p>Selim, now safe on his throne, turned his attention to
war with Persia. The principal cause of conflict arose
out of a dispute on religion. From an early time the
Mahommedan world had been divided into two hostile
sects—the Sunnites and the Schiis. The point of difference
was whether authority should be attributed to the
writings of the four immediate descendants of the Prophet,
as the Schiis contended, or whether the words of the
Prophet alone should be conclusive on matters of dogma.
It would seem that the smaller the difference in dogma
between two sects of a religious body, the worse they
hate one another; and just as the Christians of the Greek
and Latin Churches hated one another more than they
hated the followers of Mahomet, so the Sunnites and the
Schiis hated one another to the point that they were each
bent on exterminating the other—though the difference
between them might seem to outsiders to be no greater
than that between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</p>

<p>Persia was the headquarters of the Schiis. In the
Ottoman Empire the Sunnites greatly prevailed. But of
late years the Schiis had gained ground in Asia Minor.
Selim, who was a bigoted follower of Mahomet, determined
to extirpate this heresy throughout his Empire.
With devilish zeal he employed an army of spies to ferret
out the heretics, and on a given day seventy thousand of
them were arrested. Forty thousand of them were put to
death, and the remainder were condemned to terms of
imprisonment. This violent action does not seem to have
aroused any popular indignation against Selim. It earned
for him in Turkey the title of ‘the Just,’ and diplomats
of the day and historians wrote of it in laudatory terms.
It was a proof of the possibility of extirpating a heresy
if the means adopted were ruthlessly carried out. The
Schii heresy was extinguished, once for all, in the Ottoman
Empire. This exploit, however, added to the animosity
already existing between the Persians and the Ottomans,
and made war between them inevitable. The immediate
clash was hastened by the Persians giving asylum to Murad,
a son of Ahmed, who had not been included in the slaughter
of his cousins at Brusa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Persia, at this time, was under the rule of Shah Ismail,
a most capable and successful ruler, who had renovated
the kingdom, and added largely to it by the conquest
and subjection of many minor adjoining States. The two
potentates were well matched in vigour and ability. When
war with Persia was propounded by Selim in his council,
there was ominous silence. There was evidently fear of
the undertaking. The Janissary guarding the entrance to
the chamber broke down the suspense by throwing himself
on his knees before Selim and expressing ardent
support to the war. This precipitated a decision by the
council, and the Janissary was at once promoted to high
office.</p>

<p>Early in March, 1514, a hundred and forty thousand
men and three hundred guns were collected on the Asian
side of the Bosphorus, under command of the Sultan.
Sixty thousand camels were provided to carry its baggage
and munitions. The army commenced its march on
April 20th. Its aim was Tabriz, then the capital of Persia,
distant from Scutari, as the crow flies, by over one thousand
miles of a mountainous country, in which there were no
roads. The main difficulty was the supply of the army
with food for men, horses, and camels. This was partly
effected from Trebizond, to which the command of the Black
Sea enabled Selim to send supplies from Constantinople.</p>

<p>Selim preluded his campaign by an insolent letter to
Shah Ismail. In the course of it he said:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is only by the practice of the true religion that a man will prosper
in this world and deserve eternal life in the world to come. As for thee,
Emir Ismail, such a reward will never be thy lot; for thou hast deserted
the path of salvation and of the holy commandment; thou hast denied the
purity of the doctrine of Islam; thou hast dishonoured and cast down the
altars of God; thou hast by base stratagem alone raised thyself and
sprung from the dust—to a seat of splendour and glory; thou hast
opened to Mussulmans the gate of tyranny and oppression; thou hast
forced iniquity, perjury, and blasphemy to impiety, heresy, and schism;
thou hast, under the cloak of hypocrisy, sown in all parts the seeds of
trouble and sedition; thou hast raised the standard of ungodliness; thou
hast given way to thy shameful passions and abandoned thyself without
restraint to the most disgraceful excesses.... Therefore, as the first
duty of a Mussulman, and above all of a pious prince, is to obey the
commandment, “Oh ye faithful who believe, perform ye the decrees of
the Lord”—the ulemas and our teachers of the law have pronounced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>death against thee, perjurer and blasphemer as thou art, and have laid
upon every good Mussulman the sacred duty of taking arms for the
defence of religion and for the destruction of heresy and impiety, in thy
person and the persons of those who follow thee.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the approach of Selim and his army to the frontier
of Persia, Shah Ismail, instead of going out to meet his
foe, laid waste the whole country and retreated towards
his capital. This greatly increased the difficulty Selim
had of supplying his army. The soldiers were exhausted
by the long march. The Janissaries began to murmur.
One of the generals, Hemdar Pasha, who had been brought
up with Selim from his earliest childhood, and might be
expected to have great influence with him, was persuaded
by his brother officers to remonstrate with the Sultan
against further prosecution of the invasion of Persia, through
a country where every vestige of food was destroyed.
The Sultan met the suggestion by ordering the instant
decapitation of the pasha.</p>

<p>Selim endeavoured to provoke Ismail to meet him in battle
by another insolent letter, written mainly in verse, taunting
him with cowardice. “One who, by perjury,” he wrote,
“seizes sceptres, ought not to skulk from danger....
Dominion is a bride to be wooed and won by him only
whose lip blanches not at the biting kiss of the sabre’s
edge.” Ismail replied in a dignified letter denying the
existence of any reason for war, and expressing willingness
to resume peaceful relations. He suggested that
Selim’s letter, written in a style so unfitting the dignity
of the Sultan, must have been the hasty production of a
secretary, who had taken an overdose of opium. The
taunt was a bitter one, for it was well known that Selim
was addicted to opium. The letter was accompanied by
the present of a box of opium to the supposed secretary.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Selim and his army marched on with
ever-increasing difficulties of supplies. The soldiers at last
broke out in open revolt and demanded to be led back
to their homes. Selim took the bold course of riding into
the midst of them and addressing them personally.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Is this [he said] your service to your Sultan? Does your loyalty consist
of mere boast and lip worship? Let those among you who wish to go
stand out from the ranks and depart. As for me, I have not advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>thus far merely to double back on my track. Let the cowards instantly
stand aloof from the brave who have devoted themselves with sword and
quiver, soul and hand to our enterprise.</p></blockquote>

<p>He gave word of command to form columns and march,
and not a single man dared to leave the ranks.</p>

<p>On the approach of the Ottoman army to Tabriz, Ismail
was at last drawn from his reserve. He determined to
give battle. The two armies met at Calderan, not far
from the capital, on August 14th, 116 days from the
commencement of the march, which must have covered
nearly twelve hundred miles. This was a great performance
on the part of the Turkish army. It was by this time
reduced to one hundred and twenty thousand men, of whom
eighty thousand were cavalry. The Persian army consisted
of eighty thousand cavalry, splendidly mounted and
equipped, and well trained. But there were no infantry
and no guns. The Turkish soldiers were fatigued by their
long march. They were ill-fed and the horses were stale
and out of condition. The issue turned upon the success
of the charges of the Persian cavalry. They attacked
the Turks with great impetuosity in two bodies on either
flank. That under command of Ismail himself was successful
and broke and dispersed the opposing wing of
the Turks. The other column was unsuccessful. The
Ottomans fell back behind their guns. The Janissaries
formed a solid front. The cannons opened a destructive
fire, which was supported by the fire of the Janissaries, who
were now armed with muskets. The Persians were shattered
and destroyed. The defeat of the other wing of the Turkish
army was retrieved. Twenty-five thousand Persian horsemen
lay dead on the field. Ismail himself was badly
wounded and escaped with difficulty.</p>

<p>After this victory Selim entered Tabriz, and remained
there eight days. It was his wish to winter in Persia
and to renew his campaign in the following spring, but
his soldiers objected and insisted on being led home. This
time Selim found himself unable to refuse. He turned
homeward with his army. No terms of peace were concluded
with Ismail, and the two countries continued
nominally at war during the remainder of Selim’s life.
But the great provinces of Diarbekir and Khurdistan
remained in the hands of the Turks. Selim left them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
charge of the well-known Turkish historian, Idris, who
spent the next year in organizing these two departments
and in putting down any attempt at resistance. He was
eminently successful in this, and the two provinces were
permanently annexed to the Ottoman Empire. The whole
campaign of Selim must be considered as a most striking
success. To have marched a hundred and forty thousand
men, with eighty thousand horses and three hundred guns,
over twelve hundred miles, and to have defeated a powerful
army, backed by all the resources of a great country,
was an achievement which earned for Selim a place in
the first rank of great generals. Selim does not appear
to have been anxious to include Persia in his Empire. His
hatred of the Schii heresy was such that he aimed rather
at isolation than annexation. He issued a firman forbidding
any trade with Persia, and when a number of merchants
were reported to him for having broken the law by entering
into illicit trade with the Persians, he ordered them
to be executed. He was only with difficulty induced to
revoke the order by the Mufti Djemali.</p>

<p>On his return to Constantinople Selim, inflamed by his
success in putting down the heresy of the Schiis and
his victory over heretical Persia, determined to extirpate
Christianity from his dominion. Again with the greatest
difficulty he was dissuaded from this course by the
courageous Mufti. But he insisted on depriving the
Christians in Constantinople of all their churches, which
he turned into mosques.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1516 Selim determined to extend his
Empire by the conquest of Syria and Egypt. These
countries had been for many years past under the rule of the
Mamelukes, a body of soldiers recruited from Circassian
slaves, and from whose ranks Sultans were elected for their
lives. The existing Sultan, Kansar Ghowri, was eighty years
of age, but was still able to take command in the field of
his Mamelukes. The immediate pretext for war, as in
the case of Persia, was a religious one. A claim was
preferred by Selim for the protection of the holy cities of
Mecca and Medina.</p>

<p>On June 26th Selim arrived at Konia, and thence sent
an insolent missive of defiance to Ghowri, who was at
Aleppo. In return, a mission was sent to the Turkish
headquarters. It consisted of an envoy and a suite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
ten Mamelukes in splendid military array and glittering
with armour. Selim was indignant at this warlike demonstration.
He directed the immediate execution of the ten
members of the suite, and with difficulty was persuaded
not to deal in the same way with the envoy. As an
alternative the envoy was shorn of his beard and hair, his
head was covered by a nightcap, and he was mounted
on a broken-down donkey, and was returned in this
ignominious way to Ghowri.</p>

<p>The two armies met in battle not far from Aleppo.
The issue was not in doubt. The Egyptians had no guns.
They also suffered from the defection of the Djellans, a
section of Mamelukes of the second and inferior rank.
An hour sufficed to ensure complete victory to the Turks.
Ghowri fled and died, trampled to death, it was said, by
the mass of fugitives. The victory caused the loss not
only of Aleppo but of the whole of Syria. Selim, after
a few days at Aleppo, went to Damascus, and there
organized the invasion of Egypt. This involved the provision
of many thousands of camels to carry water for
the troops when crossing the desert. He sent five thousand
men to Gaza, under Sinan Pasha, the brave general who
had led the victorious wing of his army against the Persians.
They met there an Egyptian army of about the same
number, and a fierce battle ensued, which resulted in the
defeat of the Mamelukes, mainly owing to the Ottoman
artillery.</p>

<p>Selim left Damascus with his main army on December
16th. On arrival at Gaza he ordered the immediate
slaughter of all its inhabitants. He also directed the
execution of one of his own generals who ventured to
point out to him the danger of an invasion of Egypt.
On January 10th the arrangements for this expedition were
complete. Ten days were occupied in crossing the desert
between Syria and Egypt. The army was harassed by
Arabs, but there was no attempt to resist on the part
of the main Egyptian army. When, at one time, the
Grand Vizier, thinking that the cloud of Arabs meant a
more serious resistance, persuaded Selim to mount his
war-horse, the Sultan, on finding it was a false alarm and
that it was only an affair with Arabs, directed the execution
of the Vizier.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year 1516 Selim arrived with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
his army within a few miles of Cairo. Meanwhile the
Mamelukes had elected Tourman Bey as Sultan to succeed
Ghowri. But there was much opposition to this on the
part of those who favoured the claim of the son of Ghowri.
As a result, there was dissension in the Egyptian army.
Two of their leaders, Ghazali Bey and Khair Bey, entered
into treasonable relations with Selim. Ghazali persuaded
Tourman to send the guns, with which the Egyptian army
was now provided, by the ordinary route, and then secretly
sent information of this to Selim, who was able to
avoid the guns by taking another route.</p>

<p>The two armies met near Ridania. The battle resulted
in the complete defeat of the Egyptians, with a loss of
twenty-five thousand men, owing to their want of guns.
Selim then advanced on Cairo. There was no resistance
at first, but later the Mamelukes reoccupied it and made
a desperate resistance to the Turkish army. The streets
were barricaded and every house was turned into a fortress.
Selim spent three days in getting possession of the city.
Eight hundred Mamelukes who surrendered on promise
of their lives were put to death. A general massacre of
the inhabitants then took place, and fifty thousand of them
perished by the sword, or were thrown into the flames of
the burning houses. As a result of this, and further
military operations in the Delta, Egypt was completely
subdued. The brave and generous Tourman was taken
prisoner and, after denouncing the two traitors in the
presence of Selim, was put to death.</p>

<p>Some months were then occupied by Selim in organizing
the conquered country. It was not annexed as an integral
part of Turkey. The Mamelukes, or rather the section
of them who had been unfaithful to their Sultan, and who
had survived the general slaughter, were entrusted with
the administration of Egypt, subject to the superior control
of a pasha appointed by the Turkish government.
Ghazali and Khair Bey received the reward of their treason—Ghazali
was appointed Governor of Syria and Khair Bey
of Egypt. A garrison of five thousand Ottoman soldiers
was left at Cairo. The Turkish army insisted on an
early return to Constantinople. A war against Moslems,
where there was no opportunity of making captives for
sale as slaves or for harems, had no charm for them. Selim
had once more to give way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>It was not till September 17th that he was able to commence
his homeward march. Having safely passed the
desert, he said to his Grand Vizier, Younis Pasha, who was
riding beside him, “Well, our backs are now turned on
Egypt and we shall soon be at Gaza.” Younis, who had
originally been opposed to the expedition, could not resist
the reply: “And what has been the result of all our
trouble and fatigue, if it is not that half our army has
perished in battle, or in the sands of the desert, and that
Egypt is now governed by a gang of traitors?” This
imprudent speech cost the Grand Vizier his life. His
head was struck off as he rode by his master’s side.</p>

<p>The conquest of Egypt entailed the acquisition of the
interests of that country in a great part of Arabia, including
the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Selim was also able
to induce the titular Caliph, who through many generations
had inherited from the early successors of Mahomet a
certain undefined authority in the religious world, and who
held a shadowy Court at Cairo, to make over to him and
his successors, as Sultans of Turkey, the barren office,
together with its symbols, the standard and cloak of the
Prophet. These symbols were removed to Constantinople,
and thenceforth the Sultans assumed the title of Caliphs
and Protectors of the Holy Places—and this may have
added to their prestige in the Moslem world, though
it may be doubted whether it contributed much to the
strength of the Turkish Empire. Of more material
advantage was the fact that an annual tribute was paid
by the Egyptian government, which a few years later,
under Solyman, was fixed at 80,000 ducats. It also contributed
men and ships to wars undertaken by the Sultan.
In the siege of Rhodes, in 1524, Egypt sent three thousand
Mamelukes and twenty vessels of war.</p>

<p>Selim spent some time at Damascus and Aleppo on his
way back in organizing his new acquisitions. Syria was
incorporated in the Turkish Empire, and has remained
so to the present time.</p>

<p>The campaign which ended in the conquest of Egypt
and Syria was not less conspicuous in its result than
that against Persia, more on account of the difficulties
of organization, than for success on the field of battle.
Treason and the want of artillery were more responsible
for the defeat of the Mamelukes than the valour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Ottoman troops. It is not easy for us to understand why
Egypt was not incorporated in the Empire in the same
way as Syria. The Mamelukes were as much strangers to
the country as the Turks themselves. The minority of
them, who survived the war and the bloody executions
by Selim, had no claim to recognition as the ruling class
in Egypt, other than their treachery to their fellow-Mamelukes
and their Sultan and the aid which they had given
to the invaders. It will be seen that these surviving Mamelukes
soon regained full power in Egypt, and reduced the
pashas appointed from Constantinople to puppets.</p>

<p>Selim returned to his capital in 1518. In the remaining
two years of his life there were no further military exploits.
He made great preparations for another campaign. He
added greatly to the strength of his navy. He built a
hundred and fifty ships of war, many of them of great
size for those days. It was generally believed that he
intended an attack on Rhodes to avenge the defeat of his
grandfather, the acquisition of which, lying as it did across
the route to Egypt, was of great importance. Before,
however, any decision was arrived at, Selim died on his
way to Adrianople, very near to the spot where his father
had been poisoned by his orders. He left the reputation
of being one of the ablest organizers of victory, but also
the most cruel despot of the Othman line. It was for long a
common expression with the Turks, by way of a curse,
“May’st thou be a vizier to Sultan Selim.”</p>

<h2><small>X.</small><br /><br />

SOLYMAN THE MAGNIFICENT<br />

<small>1520-66</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Selim</span> was succeeded by his only son, Solyman, at the
age of twenty-six, who reigned for forty-six years, a period
of unexampled splendour in the history of the Ottoman
Empire—its culminating era. This was mainly due to
the personal qualities of the new Sultan. He surpassed
all his predecessors, and still more his degenerate successors,
in dignity and graciousness. He was not behind the best
of them in military capacity, vigour of action, and personal
courage. He combined with these qualities statesmanship
of high order. With rare exceptions he stood by his
engagements and did not follow the precept of the Koran
that faith need not be kept with infidels. He was great
as an administrator and legislator. Before he mounted
the throne he had been employed by his father as governor
of three very important provinces, and had gained a
high reputation for his determination to secure justice to
his subjects, whatever their race or creed. His private life
was free from scandal. He was noted for his clemency
and kindness of heart. If massacres took place after
victories or after capture of fortresses when he was in
command, it was because he could not restrain his turbulent
and bloodthirsty Janissaries; but the occasions of such scenes
were comparatively rare. He had, however, a blend of
cruelty in his character, as had most of his predecessors.
Being an only son, he had no occasion, on mounting the
throne, to carry out the fratricidal law of Mahomet II. But
he was determined that there should be no possible rival in
his family, however remote. After the surrender of Rhodes,
two years later, on the promise of life and property to its
defenders, he singled out, in breach of his promise, a son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of Prince Djem, who was one of those included in the
amnesty, and directed the immediate execution of him and
his four sons. Worse also than fratricide was the murder
by Solyman of two of his own sons. The eldest of them,
Mustapha, was a most promising prince. He had already
shown his capacity as governor of a province. He was
endowed with all his father’s best qualities. He was the
idol of the army and the hope of his country.</p>

<p>Solyman was persuaded by his latest favourite concubine,
a Russian lady, Ghowrem by name, who had unbounded
influence over him and retained it till late in life, that Prince
Mustapha was intriguing against him, and aimed at dethroning
him, as Selim had done in the case of Bayezid.
She hoped to secure the succession for her own son. Without
a word of warning or any opportunity of defending
himself, Mustapha, in the course of the second Persian
campaign in 1553, on entering his father’s tent, was seized
by the mutes and was strangled while Solyman looked on
at the foul deed. There was more excuse for putting to
death another son, Bayezid, who had been goaded by an
intrigue in the Sultan’s harem into taking up arms, in 1561,
against his brother Selim. He was defeated and fled to
Persia, where he was at first received with great honour
by Shah Talmasp, the successor to Ismail, with the distinct
promise that he would not be given up. But Solyman
obtained his extradition by threat of war and the promise
of 400,000 pieces of gold. The unfortunate prince was
treated with the greatest indignity. His hair and beard
were shorn. He was handed over, together with his four
sons, to an emissary of his brother Selim, who at once
put to death the whole party.</p>

<p>As a result of the murders of these two sons of Solyman,
a third one, the son of Ghowrem, was the only heir to the
throne. He succeeded Solyman and was known as “Selim
the Sot.” It will be seen that this prince had none of the
qualities of his race. He was the first of a long line of
degenerates who eventually lost the greater part of the
Empire which had been built up by Solyman and his
predecessors.</p>

<p>Though the office of Grand Vizier was not so dangerous
to its holders as under Selim I, it proved to be fatal to
two of the nine men who held it during Solyman’s reign.
One of the most remarkable incidents of Solyman’s life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
was his infatuation for Ibrahim, the second of his Grand
Viziers. Ibrahim, a renegade Greek by birth, had
been captured as a boy by corsairs and sold as a slave to
a widow in Magnesia, who brought him up as a Mussulman.
Recognizing his talents, this lady gave him an excellent
education. Solyman, on a visit to that province, came
across Ibrahim, and, attracted by his musical talent, took
him into service, where he rose to be master of the pages
and grand falconer. He soon acquired immense influence
over his master, whose sister was given to him in marriage.
He was rapidly promoted, and in 1523 was appointed Grand
Vizier. The Sultan and his favourite became inseparable.
They had their meals alone together. They concerted
between them all the affairs of State. Ibrahim justified this
preference, for he proved to be of great capacity, not
inferior in any respect to his master, and his superior in
education and knowledge of languages and history. He
was appointed Seraskier, or Commander-in-Chief, when the
Sultan was unable personally to command. In the earlier
campaigns in Hungary and Persia, and in the siege of
Vienna, he took a most active part, and was the main
adviser to his master.</p>

<p>After thirteen years of implicit confidence in Ibrahim, suspicion
arose in the mind of the Sultan and was fanned by
the Sultana Ghowrem, who coveted the post of Grand Vizier
for her son-in-law, Roostem Pasha. There does not appear
to have been any ground for these suspicions, save that
Ibrahim, intoxicated by his elevation, assumed the airs
almost of an equal with the Sultan. A vizier suspected
was very near to his doom. Entering the palace one
day in 1536 to dine with the Sultan as usual, he was
never seen alive again. The next morning his body was
found in the palace. His immense wealth was confiscated to
the State. It was said that Solyman in an adjoining room
to that where this murder was perpetrated was smothered
with kisses by Ghowrem so as to drown the cries of the
dying Vizier.</p>

<p>In another case, the Grand Vizier Achmet was decapitated
in the council chamber by order of Solyman, solely because
he gave advice which displeased his master. Von Hammer
gives a long list of other high officials who shared the
same fate.</p>

<p>During the forty-six years of his reign Solyman added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
enormously to the Empire. Belgrade, Rhodes, nearly the
whole of Hungary, the Crimea, the great provinces of Mossul,
Bagdad, and Bassorah, and a part of Armenia taken from
Persia, Yemen and Aden in Arabia, Algiers, Oran, and
Tripoli, and an undefined extent of hinterland inhabited by
Arabs in North Africa, and a wide extension of Egypt in the
direction of Nubia, were the contributions which he transmitted
to his successors. There were few years of his long
reign in which he was not under arms. War with Hungary
and Austria in the north alternated with war with Persia in
the east and with Spain in the west. Solyman was often in
command of his armies. He conducted personally thirteen
campaigns, some of them, such as those against Persia,
extending over two years. For the most part these wars
were embarked on without any just or even plausible
cause. They were stimulated by lust of conquest on the
Sultan’s part, and by craving for active service and for
loot on the part of the Janissaries. Religious fanaticism
seems to have had little concern with the motives or results
of them.</p>

<p>Solyman’s first campaign, in 1521, was directed against
Belgrade, the city which had successfully defied Mahomet II.
He marched against it at the head of an army of a hundred
thousand men with three hundred guns. It was bravely
defended by the Hungarians. But they had no guns. After
seven days of bombardment the city was assaulted and
captured. There was no massacre of the garrison or the
inhabitants. Solyman converted the principal church into
a mosque. The city was thenceforth garrisoned by a
Turkish force. It constituted the principal stronghold of
the Empire on the Danube, and was the gateway for many
invasions of Hungary.</p>

<p>In the next year, 1523, Solyman followed up this success
by an attack on the island of Rhodes, where Mahomet had
also failed, and the capture of which had become more
important since the conquest of Egypt, lying as it did on
the direct route by sea from Constantinople. For this
purpose Solyman sent a fleet of three hundred vessels with
eight thousand Janissaries and a hundred siege guns.
He marched at the head of a hundred thousand men
through Asia Minor to the bay of Marmerice, opposite to
Rhodes, whence they were conveyed to the island. The
knights, six hundred in number, with only five thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
trained soldiers and a <i>levée</i> of peasants on the island,
made a heroic defence under their Grand Master, de
Lisle Adam. It was only after a siege of nine months
that they were at last compelled to capitulate. It was
the first occasion on which a great fortress was approached
by sap and spade work, so as to avoid gun fire, and in which
bombs were used by the attacking army. Solyman’s army
is said to have lost fifty thousand men in casualties and
as many more by disease. Under the terms of capitulation,
the survivors of the garrison with all their personal property
were to be conveyed to Crete, after twelve days, in their own
galleys. After an interview with the Grand Master the Sultan
is reported to have said, with great generosity, “It is not
without regret that I force this brave man from his home
in his old age.” The arms of the knights are still to be
seen carved on the houses they occupied in Rhodes. The
Turks have always respected them in memory of the gallant
defence. The terms of surrender were faithfully observed by
Solyman with the exception already referred to. The knights
eventually settled at Malta, at that time a nearly desert
island. They made it the seat of their order and fortified
it. Its central position in the Mediterranean made it a
stronghold of the utmost importance. Solyman, in the
last year but one of his long reign, thought it necessary
for the expansion of his Empire, in the North of Africa, to
oust the knights from their new nest. He sent an army and
a fleet under command of Piale Reis to besiege it. There
commenced another celebrated siege in which the knights,
under command of their Grand Master, Lavallette, covered
themselves with glory. The Turks were defeated in many
assaults on the fortress, and were ultimately compelled to
withdraw with heavy losses.</p>

<p>The two years after the conquest of Rhodes were spent
by Solyman in organizing his kingdom. His inaction was
greatly resented by the Janissaries, who hated their dull
life in barracks and longed for war and for loot. They
broke out in revolt and pillaged the houses of Ibrahim
and other great functionaries. The outbreak was quelled,
Solyman killing with his own hand three of the rebels.
Their Agha and other leaders were put to death. But
Solyman found it expedient to appease the mercenaries
by generous presents, and in the next year—mainly at
their instigation—embarked on another war. He was urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
to invade Hungary by Francis I, King of France, who
hoped to create a diversion from the ambitious projects of
the Emperor Charles V. This may be considered as the
first entry of the Turks into the maze of European politics.
Hungary and Bohemia were at that time united under the
rule of Louis II, a very young and inexperienced man.</p>

<p>In April, 1526, Solyman and his Grand Vizier, Ibrahim,
with a hundred thousand men and three hundred guns,
marched to Belgrade, and thence invaded Hungary. On
August 27th, five months after their departure from Constantinople,
they met the Hungarian army at Mohacz, not far
from the Danube, and about half-way from Belgrade to Buda,
then, as now, the capital of Hungary. The battle was
quickly decided. The Ottoman army had the advantage of
an overwhelming superiority both of men and guns. The
Hungarians were defeated. Their King, eight bishops, a
great majority of the Hungarian nobles, and twenty-four
thousand men were killed. This decided the fate of
Hungary. Before marching onwards, Solyman ordered
all the prisoners he had taken—four thousand in number—to
be put to death. He reached Buda on September
10th. The city surrendered. Solyman received
there the submission of a number of Hungarian nobles
who had survived the disaster of Mohacz. At his instance,
Count Zapolya, one of the magnates of Hungary and
Voivode of Transylvania, was elected by them as King
of Hungary in succession to Louis II, who had left no
heir. Solyman shortly after this—influenced in part by
news of civil disturbance in Asia Minor—left Buda and
retreated to the Danube, and thence returned to his capital.
The temporary occupation of part of Hungary had been
attended with fearful devastation and with great loss of
life to its population. It was estimated that two hundred
thousand men were massacred. The retreating army
carried off an immense booty and drove before them
about a hundred thousand captives of both sexes, who
were eventually sold as slaves at Constantinople. Garrisons
were left by the Turks in some of the frontier fortresses of
Hungary.</p>

<p>The election of Count Zapolya as King of Hungary
under the dictation of the Turks led to civil war in that
country. Archduke Ferdinand, brother of Charles V,
to whom the Emperor had transferred his Archduchy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Austria, claimed the throne of Hungary, by virtue of a treaty
between the Emperor and the late King Louis. On the
other hand, it was claimed by Zapolya and his adherents
that, under an ancient law of Hungary, no one but a native
could be elected as King. In spite of this, the nobles of
Western Hungary met in Diet at Presburg and elected
Ferdinand. Ferdinand appealed to arms, and was supported
by the Austrians. He defeated his rival. Zapolya was driven
from the country. He fled to Poland, and thence he appealed
to the Sultan for aid in support of his claims in Hungary.
Ferdinand, hearing of this, sent an envoy to the Sultan.
Most unwisely, he not only claimed assistance in support
of his claims to the throne of Hungary, but he demanded
that Belgrade and other towns in Hungary in possession
of the Sultan should be given up. Ibrahim, the Grand
Vizier, who conducted the negotiations with the two rivals,
was most arrogant. He claimed that every place where the
hoofs of the Sultan’s horses had once trod became at once
and for ever part of the Ottoman Empire. “We have
slain,” he said, “King Louis of Hungary. His kingdom
is now ours to hold or to give to whom we list. It is not
the crown that makes the King, it is the sword. It is the
sword that brings men into subjection; and what the
sword has won the sword will keep.”</p>

<p>The Sultan decided against Ferdinand and said to
Zapolya’s envoy, “I will be a true friend to thy master.
I will march in person to aid him. I swear it by our
Prophet Mahomet, the beloved of God, and by my sabre.”
To the rival’s agent he said that he would speedily visit
Ferdinand and drive him from the kingdom he had stolen.
“Tell him that I will look for him on the field of Mohacz
or even in Buda, and if he fail to meet me there, I
will offer him battle beneath the walls of Vienna.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of these threats, Solyman, in 1529, at
the head of two hundred and fifty thousand men and with
three hundred guns, again invaded Hungary and laid siege
to Buda. The city surrendered at the instance of traitors
among its defenders. Under the terms of capitulation
life and property were to be preserved to the garrison and
the citizens. The Janissaries, furious at the loss of loot,
refused to recognize the terms. They massacred all the
garrison as they issued from the fortress, and they carried
off for sale most of the young women of the town. Zapolya<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
was reinstated as a vassal King of that part of Hungary.
Solyman then marched on to Vienna. He arrived there
on September 27, 1529, with over two hundred thousand
men. There ensued the first of the two memorable sieges
of Vienna by the Ottomans.</p>

<p>Charles V, Emperor of Germany, was at this time the
greatest and most powerful sovereign in Europe. He had
inherited the kingdoms of Spain, the Netherlands, Naples
and Sicily, as well as his possessions in Germany. Born
six years later than Solyman, he was elected Emperor of
Germany a year before the accession of Solyman as Sultan.
He abdicated his throne and retired to a monastery ten
years before the death of Solyman. For thirty-six years,
therefore, their reigns were synchronous. It would be hard
to say which of the two sovereigns was the more valiant
in arms, or the more astute statesman. Judged by the
extent of conquests, Solyman far surpassed his rival.
Charles did little more than maintain the integrity of his
immense inherited possessions in Europe. But he acquired
by conquest Tunis in Africa, and Mexico and Peru in
America.</p>

<p>When Solyman, instigated by Francis I of France, was
invading Austria, Charles was deeply engaged in war against
France in Italy, and could not send an army to meet the
Ottomans in the field. Vienna was left to stand the brunt
of invasion without a protecting army. Its garrison consisted
of only sixteen thousand soldiers under Count de
Salms. Its fortifications were only a continuous wall 5 feet
in thickness and without bastions. Its guns were only
seventy-two in number. Such weak defences seemed to offer
little hope against the overwhelming numbers of the Ottomans.
The tents of the Sultan and his army whitened the
whole plain round the city. Irregular cavalry, called
Scorchers, depending on loot for their food and pay, ravaged
the country for miles round the city with incredible cruelty
and rapacity. A Turkish flotilla of four hundred small
vessels found its way up the Danube, after destroying all
bridges, and lent assistance to the siege. It was all in vain.
The Austrian and Spanish troops under the Count de Salms
defended the weak lines with the utmost courage and
tenacity. The Viennese citizens constructed lines of earthworks
within the walls, against which the lighter guns of
the Turks had little effect. The powerful siege guns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the Ottomans had been left behind <i>en route</i>, owing to heavy
rains and the badness of roads. Numerous assaults were
made by the Turks. The soldiers were at last dispirited by
failure. In vain their officers drove them on by sticks and
sabres. The men said they preferred death from their
officers to death from the long arquebuses of the Spaniards.
Twenty ducats a head were given or promised to them.
It was to no purpose. Solyman, after three weeks of
fruitless assaults, found himself compelled to raise the
siege and to retreat with his great army. His irregulars
had so ravaged the country that he had the utmost difficulty
in feeding his men.</p>

<p>Before striking the camp all the immense booty taken in
the campaign was burnt. The prisoners, most of them the
peasantry of the district round Vienna, were massacred.
Only the fairest of the young women were carried off
captives to be sold as slaves. The Sultan returned to Constantinople.
There was no pursuit of his army. It came
back intact. It was a slur on the fame of Solyman that
he endeavoured to conceal his failure to capture Vienna by
lying accounts of success, and by a popular celebration of
triumph, on return to his capital. There was this much
to be said for him, that he had flouted the Austrians, by
invading their country and devastating it up to the walls
of Vienna, without any attempt, on their part, to meet him
in the field or to follow him up on his retreat.</p>

<p>Three years later, in 1532, Solyman, with another
immense army, again invaded Hungary, with the avowed
object of marching to Vienna and attacking the army of
the Emperor. Charles V, on this occasion, took command
of the Austrian army. It was expected that a trial
of strength would take place between the two potentates,
and would decide which of them was the stronger. But
Solyman’s progress was delayed by the heroic defence for
three weeks of the small fortress of Guns. After its capture
Solyman made no further advance towards Vienna, but
turned aside and devastated Styria, and then led his army
homeward. The Emperor, on his part, made no effort
to meet his foe and join conclusions with him. It was
evident that both of them were anxious to avoid the issue
of a great battle.</p>

<p>Though the Sultan had retreated and had returned to
Constantinople, peace was not concluded, and a desultory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
war was continued for some years between Ferdinand and
Zapolya. Peace was concluded in 1538, under which
Zapolya was to retain the title of King of Eastern Hungary
and Transylvania and Ferdinand was acknowledged ruler
of the western half. In 1566 Solyman again invaded Hungary,
on his thirteenth and last campaign, to which we will
revert later.</p>

<p>We have thus described briefly the course of events
between the Turks and the Hungarians, supported by
Austria. Though the conquests of Solyman in this direction
had been arrested by his failure to capture Vienna, he
succeeded in securing virtual possession of the greater part
of Hungary.</p>

<p>It is necessary to revert to Solyman’s feats in other
directions. In 1534 he entered upon his sixth campaign,
this time against Persia. Shah Ismail was no longer alive,
and had been succeeded by Shah Talmasp, a very weak
personage. Solyman, as a prelude to his attack, gave
orders for the execution of all the Persian prisoners at
Gallipoli. Ibrahim was sent on, in advance, by some
months, with a large army. Instead of marching by
Aleppo to Bagdad, he took the route direct to Tabriz,
which he occupied without resistance on the part of the
Persians. He wintered there, and the next spring he was
joined by Solyman with another army, and together they
marched to Mossul and Bagdad, through a most difficult
country, where the climate entailed great losses on the
army. Bagdad was ultimately reached. It was treacherously
surrendered by its commander. In fact, the Shah
made no attempt to repel the invasion of the Ottoman
army, and the two great provinces of Mossul and Bagdad
were added to the Ottoman Empire, without any pitched
battle on the part of Persia.</p>

<p>There were other campaigns in Persia in 1548, 1553,
and 1554, in which the Turks often suffered more from
the climate and from the difficulty of obtaining supplies
than from the guerrilla attacks of the Persians. But there
was no pitched battle between the armies of the two Powers.
The Turks maintained their conquests, and have done so
to the present year (1917).</p>

<p>Not less remarkable during the long reign of Solyman
than his conquests by his army were the exploits of his
navy. It achieved victory in many hard-fought battles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
with Spain and Venice. There was no great disparity in
naval force between the Turks and the Spaniards, but when
the fleets of Venice and the Pope were combined with
those of Spain, there was great superiority on their part
in the number and size of vessels. In spite of this, in the
two great battles where this combination was against them,
the Turks were victorious, and generally, throughout
Solyman’s reign, his fleets maintained a supremacy in the
Mediterranean. This enabled him to add to his Empire
the provinces of Algiers, Oran, and Tripoli, and numerous
islands in the Ægean Sea, taken from Venice.</p>

<p>The Mussulman States of North Africa, at the commencement
of Solyman’s reign, were in the hands of
degenerate and incompetent Mahommedan rulers, who
exercised little control over the Arabs of the hinterland.
The cities on the coast were the haunts of pirates, who
sometimes sailed under the flags of these States, but more
often under no flag but their own. They preyed on the
commerce of the Mediterranean, bringing their prizes into
their ports and selling the captives as slaves, with the
result that in Tunis alone there were twenty thousand
Christian captives. These corsairs formed squadrons of ten
or twenty galleys, under the command of admirals, chosen
from the most daring and adventurous of them. They
were called corsairs, but, in fact, they were mere pirates,
knowing no law but their own, and that founded on robbery
and murder. The sea-dogs in command of these pirates
gained great experience in handling their ships and
squadrons. They ravaged the coasts of Spain, Italy, and
France, and even occasionally of England and Ireland,
devastating the cities and villages and carrying away booty
and captives.</p>

<p>It has been shown that Selim paid great attention to
his navy, and increased his ships in number and size.
Solyman followed the same course. But his admirals and
captains did not compare in skill and daring with those
of the pirate squadrons. When Solyman became aware
of this, he most astutely invited the ablest and most
experienced of these pirates to take service under the
Ottoman flag, and to bring with them their ships and
men. He gave high appointments to them, raised them
to the rank of admirals and commanders-in-chief of his
navy, over the heads of the officers of his regular service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>The first and most distinguished of these corsairs to
take naval service under Solyman was Kheireddin, better
known in history as Barbarossa. He was one of four
brothers, of Greek descent, born in Mytilene, three of
whom in early life took to piracy as a profession, under
the pretence of legitimate commerce at sea. Two of them
eventually lost their lives in the venture, but the third
survived, prospered, and made money. He collected a
squadron under his command and became the terror of
the whole Mediterranean, capturing merchant vessels and
devastating the coasts in all directions. Gathering strength
in number of ships and men, he made war on his own
account. He attacked Algiers and made himself master
of that city and its surrounding district. But finding himself
unequal to the task of maintaining an independent
rule there, he recognized the supremacy of the Sultan
of Turkey. He carried on his ships seventy thousand
fugitive Moors from Andalusia, in Spain, and settled them
at Algiers. Later, he was employed by Solyman in an
attack on Tunis, which was then under the rule of Muley-Hasan,
the twenty-second representative of the dynasty of
Boni Hafss—a degenerate reprobate, who had murdered
all but one of his forty-four brothers on his accession
to the throne, and who spent his energies in recruiting
a harem of four hundred good-looking lads. On the
pretext of putting an end to this infamy, Barbarossa
attacked the city of Tunis, and had no difficulty in getting
possession of it and expelling the contemptible Sultan. He
did not, however, remain many months in possession of
it. Muley-Hasan appealed to the Emperor Charles for aid.</p>

<p>The Emperor, in personal command of a fleet of five
hundred vessels and an army of thirty thousand men,
attacked and defeated Barbarossa in a battle before the
walls of Tunis, captured his vessels lying there, and drove
him into the interior of the country. Although he had
come there at the invitation of the Sultan of Tunis, and
the inhabitants of the city had given no assistance to
Barbarossa in defending it against the Spanish attack, the
Emperor allowed his soldiers to sack it after the capture.
A scene of almost incredible cruelty and destruction took
place. Thirty thousand of the innocent inhabitants were
massacred, and ten thousand were sold into captivity. The
mosques and all the principal buildings were burnt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
destroyed. No worse deed was ever perpetrated by any
victorious Moslem army in that age. It resulted that
Tunis, for a time, was rescued from Barbarossa and
from Ottoman rule. Muley-Hasan was reinstated there on
terms of close dependence on Spain. It was not till 1574
that Tunis finally fell into the hands of the Turks.</p>

<p>Barbarossa had made a splendid defence of the city.
His force was quite inadequate for the purpose. Solyman
was at the time engaged in war with Persia and could
not give adequate support. Shortly after this, when war
broke out between the Ottomans and Spain, the Sultan
invited Barbarossa to Constantinople, and made him Grand
Admiral of the Turkish fleet. In this capacity he fought
in 1538 a great naval battle off Prevesa against the combined
fleets of Spain, Venice, and the Pope, under Admiral
Andrea Doria, in which he achieved victory, in spite of
great inferiority of numbers and size of vessels. He
appears to have been the first to adopt the manœuvre of
breaking the line of the enemy’s fleet, for which three
centuries later Nelson was so famous. The Turkish fleet
numbered a hundred and thirty vessels, and that of the
combined Christian Powers a hundred and sixty-seven.
Six of the latter were captured and destroyed. The main
body of the combined fleet drew off, under cover of the
night. Later, Barbarossa accompanied Solyman in the
attack on Corfu, which was heroically defended by the
Venetians. The Sultan was compelled to withdraw from
the island.</p>

<p>This failure at Corfu, and that before Vienna, were the
only reverses which Solyman personally encountered in his
numerous campaigns. Barbarossa, however, in the course
of the war with the Venetians, succeeded in capturing
from them all the many islands which they possessed in
the Ægean Sea, with the exception of Crete and the few
fortified places they held in the Morea. These were his
last exploits. He died at Constantinople in 1546.</p>

<p>Others, however, of the same brood of corsairs or pirates
succeeded Barbarossa in the Turkish navy, and maintained
its reputation for successful daring. The most distinguished
of them were Dragut (or Torghut) and Piale, both of
them renegade subjects of Turkey who had taken to piracy
as a profession. Dragut, a Croatian by birth, closely resembled
Barbarossa in his career, in his prowess at sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
and in the terror which he created on the coasts of Italy
and Spain. He had little respect for the allies of the
Sultan, and captured their vessels as readily as those of
his enemies. When called to account by the Porte for
the destruction of some Venetian merchant ships, and summoned
to Constantinople, he declined to go there, well
knowing the fate in store for him. He betook himself, with
his pirate squadron, to Morocco, which he made the base
for piracy for some years. Later, Solyman, finding the
need of such a daring spirit, invited him again to take
service under the Ottoman flag, and promised to make
him Governor of Tripoli, if he could capture it. Tripoli
then belonged to the Knights of St. John at Malta. Dragut
attacked and captured it, and annexed it to the Turkish
Empire. Eventually Dragut was appointed Governor of
Tripoli and, in this capacity, led a fleet in aid of the attack
on Malta in 1565. He lost his life in an assault on the city.</p>

<p>Another such corsair was Piale, who, in his turn, after
a long spell of piracy, was taken into the Ottoman naval
service by Solyman, and rose to be commander-in-chief.
He defeated the combined fleet of Spain, Venice, and the
Pope, under command of Andrea Doria, sent to recapture
Tripoli. He attacked and annexed for the Turks the
province of Oran, on the African coast, westward of
Algiers. He commanded the Turkish fleet in the attack
on Malta in 1565, the last naval enterprise in Solyman’s
reign.</p>

<p>It was not only in the Mediterranean that Solyman’s
navy was active. A fleet was fitted out at Suez, under
command of Piri Pasha. It secured to Turkey the command
of the Red Sea and enabled the capture of Aden
and Yemen. It extended its operations thence to the
Persian Gulf and the coast of India, where it came into
conflict with the Portuguese, who beat off the Ottoman
ships.</p>

<p>The failure of the expedition to Malta, though he was
not in personal command, appears to have weighed heavily
on the mind of Solyman. It was his ambition to finish
his career by a success as signal and important as that
against Belgrade, in the first year of his reign. He determined
to take command himself of the army which was
to make another invasion of Hungary in 1566, in spite
of his seventy-two years and the feeble state of his health.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
He was not able to mount his horse. He was carried in
a litter at the head of his army. It was his special wish
to capture Szigeth and Erlau, which had successfully resisted
Ottoman attack on the last invasion. He appears
to have directed the march of his army in the minutest
detail. One of his pashas accomplished a march in one
day which he was instructed to effect in two days. Solyman
was incensed and directed the execution of the over-zealous
pasha, and with difficulty was dissuaded from this
by his Grand Vizier.</p>

<p>The great Sultan died unexpectedly in his tent from
apoplexy during the siege of Szigeth, before the capture
of this city and while the guns of his army were thundering
against its citadel, most bravely defended by Nicholas
Zriny—a fitting end to the old warrior. His death was
for long concealed from the army. The Grand Vizier
directed the execution of the Sultan’s physician, lest he
should divulge the secret. Solyman’s body was embalmed
and was carried in the royal litter during the remainder
of the short campaign in Hungary, and orders were still
given to the army in the name of the defunct Sultan. It
was not till news came that Selim had arrived at Belgrade
from his government in Asia Minor that the army, on
its homeward march, was informed of the death of the
great Sultan.</p>

<p>This was the last of Solyman’s thirteen campaigns in
which he led his armies personally on the field. There
were others in which his generals commanded. It is to
be observed of all of them that there was only one
case in which a pitched battle of any great importance
was fought on land. The single case was that of Mohacz,
already referred to, where the Ottoman army greatly exceeded
in number that of the Hungarians opposed to it,
and was provided with a park of artillery, in which the
enemy was wholly deficient. The result, therefore, was
never in doubt. With that exception, there was no great
battle either with the Hungarians, the Austrians, or the
Persians. The campaigns consisted of invasions by great
armies of the Ottomans, with heavy parks of artillery,
and with large forces of irregular cavalry, who ravaged
and devastated the invaded country. The generals opposed
to them, not being able to meet the Turks in the field,
spread their forces in numerous fortresses, more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
strong, and the campaigns consisted in besieging these
fortresses. With rare exceptions, these sieges were successful.
The Turks brought overwhelming forces to bear
on them. Their siege guns completely overmatched the
guns of the defence. It was a question of a few days or
a few weeks how long these fortresses could resist. The
wonder is that many of them resisted so long. The usual
course of such campaigns was that the Turks, having captured
the fortresses in the invaded districts, either annexed
them to their Empire, as in the case of Eastern Hungary and
Mesopotamia, or compelled the vanquished State to acknowledge
the suzerainty of the Sultan and to pay tribute, as
in the case of Western Hungary, or retired, leaving the
ravaged country so destitute of supplies that the enemy
could not follow up the retreating army.</p>

<p>Solyman was almost always successful in his campaigns—but
they do not entitle him to a place in the first
rank of great generals who have earned their laurels by
defeating opponents not unequal in number in the open
field. Practically, there was only one sovereign in Europe—namely
the Emperor Charles V—and no one in Asia,
who could hope to meet Solyman on equal terms on the
battlefield, and the Emperor evidently did not care to
measure swords with him in the open.</p>

<p>If these considerations detract from the military fame
of Solyman, they do not lessen his reputation as an
empire-builder and as an organizer of campaigns of
invasion. Seldom has an Empire been extended to such
an extent as that of the Ottomans under his efforts, with so
little expenditure of life or of the resources of the State.
Solyman evidently made it his task to run no risk of
failure, but to use such overwhelming force as made
resistance all but impossible.</p>

<p>To put in the field these enormous armies, supported by
large masses of cavalry and great parks of artillery, to
transport them from Constantinople to the centre of
Hungary, or from Scutari to the frontiers of Persia, requiring
many weeks or months, was to perform a work of
organization of the first order. In the long course of his
reign and the many expeditions led by himself and his
generals, the only failure to supply his armies in the field
with food and munitions of war was in the attack on Vienna.
Solyman had also unerring judgment and success in select<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>ing
his generals and other agents in his many campaigns.
The same may be said of his naval campaigns, in which
he took no personal part, and where success turned upon
the selection of competent admirals to command his fleets.
What a stroke of genius it was to go outside the professional
men of his naval service, and to put at the head
of his fleets and of his naval administration, such men
as Barbarossa, Dragut, Piale, and others, who had gained
experience and had made their reputation as freebooters
and pirates! It was due mainly to this that the Ottomans
acquired a virtual supremacy in the Mediterranean, that
Algiers, Oran, and Tripoli were brought under the Empire,
and that a fleet fitted out at Suez enabled the conquest of
Aden and Yemen.</p>

<p>It was not, however, only in military and naval
successes and in the additions to his Empire that Solyman
showed his greatness. His firm and resolute, yet sympathetic,
policy made its mark in every department of
the State. He insisted on impartial justice to every class
throughout his Empire. Governors of provinces, or other
high officials, who erred in this respect, and who were
guilty of injustice and cruelty, or who were corrupt and
incompetent, were at once dismissed, and not unfrequently
paid the penalty of death for their crimes. His very first
act on becoming Sultan was to order the dismissal of a
batch of unjust and corrupt officials. Von Hammer’s pages
are full of other instances of the same kind throughout
Solyman’s reign. He made no exception for favoured
persons, however near to the throne. Ferhad Pasha, who
was married to one of the Sultan’s two daughters, was
dismissed from the governorship of a province for gross
acts of injustice, cruelty, and corruption. By the urgent
entreaties of his wife, and of the Sultan’s mother, Ferhad
obtained another appointment. But on the renewal of his
misdeeds he was again dismissed, and, this time, was put
to death by order of the Sultan.</p>

<p>The finance of the Empire under Solyman was most
carefully husbanded. He fully recognized the strength
given to his country by a well-filled treasury. In spite of
his many wars, there were only two years in which he
found it necessary to levy exceptional taxes. In other
years the ordinary revenue sufficed. Taxation was comparatively
light. His wars in part paid for themselves by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
levies and exactions on the invaded countries, and by the
sale of captives. Janissaries and Spahis, numbering
together about fifty thousand, formed the standing army,
and were well paid. The holders of fiefs throughout the
Empire were bound to military service in time of war, and
to bring horses and arms. They numbered about eighty
thousand, and received no pay. Neither did the horde of
irregular cavalry, Tartars, and others who accompanied his
armies, receive pay. They provided for themselves by
ravaging the countries they passed through. Under these
conditions, the wars of Solyman were not burdensome to
the State.</p>

<p>Like so many of his predecessors, Solyman had a strong
bent to literary studies and poetry. His poems have a
reputation among his countrymen for dignity. He compiled
a daily journal of his campaigns which is of historical
value. He was a liberal patron of science and art. His
reign was the Augustan age of Turkey. He was generous
in his expenditure on mosques, colleges, hospitals, aqueducts,
and bridges, not only in Constantinople, but in all the
principal cities of his Empire.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the sobriquet ‘Magnificent’ was
given to Solyman by contemporaries in Europe. In Turkey,
he was known as ‘the Legislator.’ His reign was conspicuous
for great reforms in every branch of the law—all
aimed at justice. The land laws were overhauled. The
feudal system of fiefs, which had been partially adopted on
the model of other countries in Europe, was simplified and
improved. The position of the ‘rayas,’ was ameliorated.
Something like fixity of tenure was secured to them. The
condition of the peasantry in Turkey was distinctly better
than that of the serfs in Hungary and Russia. The
Greek population of the Morea preferred Turkish rule
to that of the Venetians. A certain number of Hungarian
peasants voluntarily left their country and settled under
the more humane government of Turkey in Roumelia.
A further proof of the general contentment of the
people through the great expanse of the Turkish Empire
was that during the forty-six years of Solyman’s reign
there was no outbreak among any one of the twenty different
races which inhabited it—and this in spite of the fact that
the country districts were denuded of troops for the many
campaigns in Hungary and Persia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
While giving Solyman full credit for all these great
achievements of his reign, it is necessary to point out that
impartial historians have detected defects in his system
of government, which grew apace under his incompetent
successors, and led inevitably to the decadence of the
Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>A Turkish historian, Kotchi Bey, who wrote on the
decline of the Ottoman Empire in 1623, about sixty years
after the death of Solyman, and who has been described
by Von Hammer as the Turkish Montesquieu, attributed
the decline in great part to the following causes:—</p>

<p>1. The cessation in Solyman’s time of the regular
attendance of the Sultan at the meetings of the Divan, or
great Council of State. Solyman had a window constructed
in an adjoining room opening into the council chamber,
where, hidden behind a veil, he could listen to the discussions
of the Divan without taking a part in them. His
successors ceased even to listen from behind the veil. This
absence of the Sultan from his Council added to his arbitrary
power and belittled the influence of his ministers.
So long as a very competent man like Solyman was on
the throne, this new practice may not have produced the
worst results, but in the case of his incompetent successors
it led to immense evils. The Sultan was finally swayed in
his decisions not by his responsible ministers or his Grand
Council, but by the inmates of his harem or by other
irresponsible and corrupt outsiders.</p>

<p>2. The habit introduced by Solyman of appointing men
to high office who had not passed through the grades of
lower offices. The first and most conspicuous case of
this kind was the promotion of Ibrahim, the favourite companion
of Solyman, from the post of Master of the Pages
in the Sultan’s household to that of Grand Vizier.
Numerous other cases could be quoted of a less conspicuous
character. Solyman, in fact, appointed outsiders to every
kind of office, however important. Eunuchs and renegades
of all kinds were elevated to the highest posts. Solyman
himself appears to have been a very good judge of men,
and rarely made mistakes in his appointments, but his
successors had no such discernment, and appointments were
conferred at the caprice, or under the influence of the
harem or otherwise, on the most unfit persons.</p>

<p>3. The venality and corruption first practised by Roostem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Pasha, who was Grand Vizier for fifteen years, and who
was married to Solyman’s daughter. The principal merit
of Roostem in the eyes of his master was his skill in
replenishing the treasury. Among the means he adopted
of raising money was the exaction of large payments from
persons on their appointment to civil offices in the State.
These payments in Solyman’s time were fixed in a definite
proportion to the salaries. They were not adopted in the
military and naval services. Under later Sultans they
became arbitrary and exorbitant, and were extended to the
army and navy. Practically appointments of all kinds were
put up to auction and given to the highest bidder. In
order to meet these payments on appointment, governors
of provinces and all officials, down to the lowest, were
induced to adopt corrupt practices of all kinds and the
sense of public duty was destroyed.</p>

<p>4. The evil practice introduced by Solyman of heaping
favours on his favourite viziers, or of allowing them to
amass wealth by selling their favours to those below them
in the official hierarchy. Ibrahim, who was Grand Vizier
for thirteen years, and Roostem for fifteen years, amassed
enormous fortunes. They set up a standard of extravagant
life, which was followed by other viziers and high officials.
Roostem on his death was possessed of 815 farms in Anatolia
and Roumelia, 476 watermills, 1,700 slaves, 2,900 coats
of mail, 8,000 turbans, 760 sabres, 600 copies of the
Koran, 5,000 books, and two millions of ducats. His
example in gaining wealth was followed by others in a
minor degree according to their opportunities. High
office came to be regarded as a means and opportunity
of acquiring great wealth, and this evil rapidly spread
throughout the Empire and led to corruption and extortion.</p>

<p>There was a corrective, or perhaps it should be called
a nemesis to this, in the fact that when an official was
put to death, by order of the Sultan, his property was confiscated
to the State. Ibrahim’s immense wealth was thus
dealt with, and even in Solyman’s time, and much more
so in those of his successors, the confiscated fortunes of
viziers, governors, and other officials sentenced to death
formed an important item in the annual income of the
State. There can be little doubt that not a few pashas
were put to death by the successors of Solyman in order
that the State might benefit from the confiscation of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
fortunes. It was perhaps thought that the mere fact of
accumulation of wealth by an official was sufficient proof
that it had been improperly acquired, and that the holder
deserved to lose his life and fortune.</p>

<p>There may be added to these causes of ultimate decadence
pointed out by the Turkish historian another which
must occur to those who closely study the reign of Solyman—namely
the growing influence in State affairs of the Sultan’s
harem. The fall and death of Ibrahim, the murder of Prince
Mustapha, and the rebellion and consequent death of Prince
Bayezid were mainly due to intrigues of the harem. Great
as Solyman was, he fell under the evil influence of his
favourite Sultana, the Russian Ghowrem, better known in
history as Roxelana. Ghowrem was not only a most seductive
concubine; she was a very clever and witty woman,
with a great gift of conversation. She retained her influence
over Solyman when age had reduced her personal
charms. By the entreaties of the Sultan’s mother, who
perceived the malign influence of this woman over her
son, she was for a time got rid of from the Seraglio.
But Solyman could not forget her, and insisted on her
recall. Ghowrem celebrated her triumph by getting the
consent of the Sultan to many executions. Thenceforth
till her death her influence was unbounded. “I live with
the Sultan,” she said, “and make him do what I wish.”
Appointments to the highest offices were made at her
instance and abuses of all kinds arose. But worst of all
was the precedent that was set for the interference of
the harem in matters of State.</p>

<p>With Solyman’s successors the influence of the harem
was continually a growing one, and was generally, though
not always, as will be seen, a danger to the State. It
became increasingly necessary for a minister who hoped
to retain his post to secure personal support in the Sultan’s
harem. The harem itself became the centre of intrigue
and corruption, with fatal effect on the interests of the
State. But worst of all dangers to the Empire was the
possibility—nay, the probability—that the succession of the
great man at the helm of State able to restrain the lawlessness
of the Janissaries, the fanaticism of the mullahs,
and the corruption of pashas might not be maintained.
Solyman never did a worse deed for the future of the
Empire than when he put to death his eldest son, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
had proved himself to be in every way fit to succeed him
as Sultan, and when later, at the instance of Ghowrem,
he secured the succession of his son Selim. He knew
that Selim was a worthless and dissolute drunkard. He
is said to have remonstrated with his son and endeavoured
to induce him to reform his conduct. It will be seen that
it was in vain. The succession of Selim was a nemesis
for the murder of Mustapha. He was the first of a long
line of degenerates, who ruined the great work of Solyman
and his predecessors.</p>

<p>In spite of this crime and of the base murder of
his most intimate friend and servant, Ibrahim, in spite
of the inception of the grave abuses we have referred to,
it must be admitted, on an impartial review of Solyman’s
reign, that Solyman was the greatest of the Othman race
who created the Empire, and that in a generation of famous
rulers in Europe, including Charles V, Francis I, Leo X,
our own Henry VIII, Sigismund of Poland, and others,
he excelled them all in the deeds and qualities which constitute
the greatness and fame of a ruler. There is a
Turkish proverb to the effect that “Happy is the man
whose faults can be numbered, for then his merits cannot
be counted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<h2><small>XI</small><br /><br />

GRAND VIZIER SOKOLLI<br />

<small>1566-78</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Solyman</span> was the last and greatest of the first ten Ottoman
Sultans who, succeeding one another from father to son,
in rather less than three hundred years, raised their Empire
from nothing to one of the most extended in the world.
They must have been a very virile race, for their reign
averaged about twenty-eight years, far above the ordinary
expectations of life. With one exception they were all able
generals and habitually led their armies in the field. They
were all statesmen, persistent in pursuing their ambitious
aims. Many of them were addicted to literary pursuits, were
students of history, and even had reputation as poets. In
spite of these softening influences, there was in nearly all
of them a fund of cruelty. It may be doubted whether, in
the world’s history, any other dynasty has produced so
long a succession of men with such eminent and persistent
qualities.</p>

<p>Solyman was succeeded by his third son, Selim, commonly
called ‘the Sot,’ a sobriquet which sufficiently
describes him. He was the only son spared from the bow-string.
Selim was followed by twenty-four other Sultans
of the Othman dynasty down to the present time. With
the rarest exception, they were men wholly wanting in
capacity to rule a great Empire. Only one of them was
capable of leading his army in the field. The others had
neither the will nor the capacity, nor even the personal
courage to do so. They fell under the influence either of
their viziers, or of the women or even of the eunuchs of
their harems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>If the persistency of type and of the high qualities
of the first ten Sultans was remarkable, no less so was the
break which occurred after Solyman, and the almost total
absence of these qualities in their successors down to the
present time. One is tempted to question whether the
true blood of the Othman race flowed in the veins of these
twenty-five degenerates. Von Hammer refers to a common
rumour at Constantinople, though he does not affirm his
own belief in it, that Selim was not really the son of Solyman
but of a Jew, and that this accounted for his infatuation
for a favourite Jew adventurer, who obtained a potent
influence over his weak mind. Such a break in true descent
might well have been possible in the vicious atmosphere
of the harem, in spite of the precaution that no men
but those deprived of virility were to be allowed to
enter it.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the explanation, there can be no doubt
that the degeneracy of the Othman dynasty dates from the
accession of Selim the Sot. But this did not necessarily
involve the immediate decadence of the Empire. The
Ottoman Empire could not have been built up by the
energy and ability of a single autocrat in each generation.
There must have been many capable men, statesmen,
generals, and administrators, of all ranks, who contributed
in each generation to the achievements of their rulers. Many
such men survived for some years the death of Solyman, and
preserved the Empire from the ruin which threatened it.
The Empire, in fact, did not begin to shrink in extent till
some years later, and for about twelve years, as if from the
momentum given to it by the powerful Sultans of the past, it
actually continued to expand. Selim was the first of the new
type of Sultans. He took no interest or part in the affairs
of State. He was a debauchee and a drunkard. He gave an
evil example to all others, high and low. Judges, cadis, and
ulemas took to drink. Poets wrote in raptures about wine.
Hafiz, the most in esteem of them, wrote that wine was
sweeter than the kisses of young girls. The attention of
the Mufti was called to this, and he was asked to censor the
poem as contrary to the injunctions of the Koran. But the
Mufti replied that “when a Sultan took to drink it was
permissible for all to do the same and for poets to
celebrate it.”</p>

<p>Selim fell completely under the influence of his Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Vizier, who had held the post for two years under Solyman.
Sokolli, who was a most capable man, was the virtual ruler
of the Empire. He was a man of large views. He had
two important and interesting schemes in his mind. The
one to cut a canal across the Isthmus of Suez, so that the
Turkish fleet might find its way into the Red Sea and
Indian Ocean, the other to make a junction by a canal
between the rivers Don and Volga. These two great rivers,
which have their sources in Russia, run a parallel course
for a long distance, and at one point approach one another
within thirty miles. They then diverge again, the one
flowing into the Sea of Azoff, the other into the Caspian
Sea. By joining these two rivers by a canal at the point
where the distance between them is the least, it would be
possible for a Turkish flotilla to ascend the Don, and then,
after passing through the canal, descend the Volga into the
Caspian Sea, whence it would be able to attack the Persian
province of Tabriz with great advantage. The commercial
possibilities of this junction of the two great water highways
were also obvious. The scheme, however, necessitated
taking Astrakan and other territory from Russia—a country
which had of late years largely extended its possessions
and power.</p>

<p>In this view, Sokolli, in 1568, sent an army of twenty-five
thousand Janissaries and Spahis by sea to Azoff.
They were there joined by thirty thousand Tartars from the
Crimea, and the combined force marched thence to
Astrakan, at the mouth of the Volga. For the first time,
therefore, the Ottomans came into direct conflict with the
Russians. The expedition was a total failure. The Turks
were unable to capture Astrakan, and a Russian army
completely destroyed that of the Tartars. The main
Turkish army was compelled to retreat to Azoff. Later, the
greater part of it was lost in a great tempest in the Black
Sea, and only seven thousand of its men returned to Constantinople.
The project of a Don and Volga canal was
consequently abandoned. That for a canal across the
Isthmus of Suez was also indefinitely adjourned, owing to
an outbreak of the Arabs in the province of Yemen, which
necessitated sending an army there under Sinan Pasha.
This was thoroughly successful, and Yemen and other parts
of Arabia were completely and finally brought under the
subjection of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>After the reconquest of Yemen, Sokolli determined to
attack Tunis, which since its capture by the Emperor
Charles V had been in the occupation of the Spaniards.
The fleet employed for this purpose was under the
command of Ouloudj Pasha, a renegade Italian, who
after a successful career as corsair and pirate was
induced to take service under the Sultan. In 1568
he was appointed governor of Algiers, and in that
capacity led the expedition against Tunis in the following
year. He defeated the Spaniards and occupied the town.
But the garrison retreated into the citadel, which they held
till 1574.</p>

<p>In 1570 another expedition was decided on, this time for
the purpose of capturing the island of Cyprus, which was
then in possession of the Republic of Venice, with which the
Porte was at peace. Sokolli, on this account, was at first
opposed to the scheme. But on this occasion, for the first
and, apparently, the only time, Sultan Selim overruled his
minister. He loved the wine of Cyprus and wished to secure
a certain supply of it. He had also, in a drunken orgy, promised
to elevate his boon companion, the Jew, to the position
of King of Cyprus. The Mufti, who had always hitherto
given a full support to Sokolli, was consulted as to whether
the treaty with Venice was binding on the Sultan so as to
make an attack on Cyprus unlawful. He issued a <i>fetva</i> to
the effect that, as Cyprus at some distant time had been
under Moslem rule, as a dependency of Egypt, it was the
duty of a Mussulman prince to avail himself of any favourable
opportunity to restore to Islam territory which had
been taken possession of by an infidel Power, and that,
consequently, the treaty with Venice was not binding on
the Sultan.</p>

<p>In accordance with this ruling of the Mufti, an expedition
was fitted out in 1570 by the Ottoman government, consisting
of a hundred thousand men, including irregulars, under
command of Kara Mustapha, who was the rival of Sokolli,
and a fleet under Piale. This force laid siege to Nicosia, the
capital of Cyprus, a flourishing Christian city, where there
were said to be as many churches as there are days in the
year. After a siege of seven weeks the city was captured
by assault, and was given up to sack by the Turkish soldiers.
Thirty thousand of the inhabitants were massacred. Many
women killed themselves and their children rather than give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
themselves up to the maddened soldiers. Two thousand
of the better-looking children of both sexes were sold as
slaves.</p>

<p>Mustapha Pasha then proceeded to invest Famagosta,
the principal fortress in the island. It was heroically
defended by a mixed force of Italians and Greeks, under
command of Bragadino, a brave Venetian general. It
successfully resisted attack throughout the winter of 1570.
It was not till August in the following year (1571) that
the garrison, reduced to less than four thousand men,
was compelled by failure of food and munitions of war to
surrender. Very favourable terms were promised to them
by Mustapha. The lives of the garrison were to be
respected, and the property and religion of the citizens
were to be secured to them. The garrison were to be
conveyed in Turkish galleys to Crete and there released.
In pursuance of these terms the captives were embarked on
board galleys ready to sail to Crete. At this stage an interview
took place between Kara Mustapha and Bragadino and
his suite of twenty officers, at which very hot words passed
between them. The Turkish general complained that some
of his men, taken prisoners during the siege, had been put
to death. Bragadino denied this. His language was considered
to be insolent by Kara Mustapha, who at once gave
orders that all Bragadino’s suite were to be strangled in
his presence. Their leader was reserved for a more cruel
fate. The men embarked on the galleys were landed again
and were massacred. A week later, Bragadino, who had
been treated in the interval with the greatest cruelty and
the most barbarous indignities, was flayed alive. His skin,
stuffed with hay, was exhibited to the scorn of the Turkish
soldiers. The capture of Famagosta completed the conquest
of Cyprus. It remained in the possession of the Ottomans
till, as will be seen, it was handed over to the British
Government, in 1878, in pursuance of a policy devised
by Lord Beaconsfield. The Turks are said to have lost
fifty thousand men in its capture. It was in revenge for
this that Kara Mustapha resorted to the terrible deeds
above described.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Christian Powers had been greatly alarmed
by the loss of Cyprus and the atrocities above described.
At the instance mainly of the Pope, an alliance was formed
in 1570 with Spain and Venice, with the object of opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the growing strength of the Ottomans in the Mediterranean.
A great fleet was fitted out by these Powers, and was placed
under the command of Don John of Austria, the natural
son of the late Emperor, Charles V, a young man of
only twenty-four years, who had shown his capacity in
the measures for the expulsion of the Moors from Spain,
and was already reckoned one of the best generals of the
time. The fleet consisted of two hundred galleys and six
powerful galleasses with heavy armaments. It was manned
by eighty thousand soldiers and rowers, one-half of whom
were provided by Spain and one-third by Venice, the
remainder, one-sixth, by the Pope. Don John was in
supreme command. The Spanish division was commanded
by the Prince of Parma, soon to become notorious in the
Netherlands under Philip II, and who was later in command
of the Armada fitted out in Spain for the invasion of
England.</p>

<p>The fleet assembled at Messina on September 21,
1571, too late for the relief of Cyprus. The Turks collected
in the Gulf of Lepanto a much greater fleet of two hundred
and ninety galleys manned by a hundred and twenty
thousand soldiers and rowers. But they had no large
galleasses with powerful armaments to compare with those
of the Spaniards. The fleet was commanded by the Capitan
Pasha Ali, a young man without experience in naval war.
The second in command was Ouloudj. Perted Pasha
was in command of the troops. He and Ouloudj were
opposed to an immediate battle with the allied fleet on the
ground that their men were not as yet sufficiently trained.
At a council of war heated discussion took place. The
Capitan Pasha insisted on immediate attack. Ouloudj
broke off the discussion, saying, “Silence. I am ready,
because it is written that the youth of a Capitan
Pasha has more weight than my forty-three years
of fighting. But the Berbers have made sport of
you, Pasha! Remember this when the peril draws
near.”</p>

<p>The rowers of both fleets were galley slaves chained to
the oars. On the Turkish fleet they were Christians who
had been made captives in war. On the Christian fleet
they were the sweepings of the jails. In both cases the
admirals promised liberty to them if they performed their
duty in the coming battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>The two fleets met near the entrance to the Gulf of
Lepanto on October 7, 1571. The Christian fleet was ranged
in a crescent with the Venetians on the left flank. The six
powerful galleasses were posted like redoubts at intervals
in front of the lines of galleys. Don John was at the centre
of the crescent. The two fleets approached one another.
The engagement soon became general. The Turkish galleys
as their enemy neared them, were somewhat broken in line
by the Spanish galleasses, which raked the Turkish galleys
with their more powerful armaments. The Turkish admiral,
in the <i>Sultana</i>, made a direct attack on Don John’s ship,
the <i>Real</i>, which was later supported by a second galley.
The three were locked together, and the Spanish soldiers
boarded the Turkish vessel. A desperate hand-to-hand
combat took place, in which the Turkish admiral was killed.
His head was cut off and, against the will of Don John, was
stuck on the masthead of the Spanish vessel. This caused
general discouragement in the Turkish fleet. All along the
line the Turkish vessels were worsted in the combats with
their opponents. There resulted a complete defeat of their
centre and left wing. Ouloudj, in command of the Turkish
right wing, was more fortunate. He succeeded in outmanœuvring
the Venetian vessels opposed to him. He
made a violent attack on fifteen galleys which were
detached from the main fleet of the allies and succeeded
in sinking them. When he became aware that
the main Ottoman fleet was completely defeated by the
Spaniards, he made a dash with forty of his own
galleys through the enemy’s line and succeeded in
escaping. With this exception, the whole of the Turkish
vessels, two hundred and sixty-six in number, were
captured or sunk. Fifty thousand Turks lost their lives
in this great battle, and fifteen thousand Christian slaves
were liberated.</p>

<p>It was an overwhelming defeat for the Ottomans. No
such naval victory had occurred in the Mediterranean
since that of Actium, very near to the same spot, where
(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 31) Marc Antony’s fleet was destroyed by that
of Octavius. Nor was there another such decisive
naval encounter in those seas till that known as the
Battle of the Nile, when Nelson captured or sank
nearly the whole of the French fleet off the coast of
Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>It was to be expected that the allied Christian fleet
would follow up its great victory by attack on some Turkish
territory. No such project was entertained by its admirals
and generals. The fleet dispersed after its victory.
Each detachment of it returned to its own ports, there
to receive ovations of triumph. Sculptors and painters
celebrated the event by works of art in churches at
Rome, Venice, Messina, and other cities. Never was
so decisive a victory productive of so little further
result.</p>

<p>The contrast between the action of the defeated Turks
and that of the victors was most striking. Ouloudj, picking
up forty stray galleys in the Ægean Sea, returned to Constantinople
with eighty vessels. Piale joined him there
with a few more. Sokolli and his colleagues in the Turkish
Government made the most determined efforts to restore
their fleet. Even Selim showed some spirit on this occasion.
He contributed largely from his privy purse. He
gave up part of the garden of his palace at Seraglio Point
as a site for the construction of new vessels. One hundred
and sixty galleys were at once commenced, together with
eight galleasses of the largest size. By the spring of the next
year they were completed. The losses at Lepanto were
made good and the Ottoman fleet was as powerful as
before the disaster. In the summer of 1572 the
allied Christian fleet was again assembled on the eastern
Mediterranean. It was still inferior in numbers of vessels
to that of the Ottomans. The two fleets came in sight of
one another twice in that season in the neighbourhood of
the island of Cerigo and, later, off Cape Matapan, but
no engagement took place. It may be concluded that
Ouloudj, who was now Capitan Pasha of the Turkish navy
with the honorary name of Killidj Ali, thought it the better
policy not to risk his new fleet before the crews were
thoroughly trained. He withdrew, and the sequel showed
the wisdom of his action. The allied fleet was unable to
do anything.</p>

<p>Later, in 1573, the Venetians found it expedient to
negotiate terms for a separate peace with the Porte.
Their envoy, who appears to have remained at Constantinople
during the late war, interviewed Sokolli for
this purpose. When he alluded to the losses which
the two Powers had recently incurred, the one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
island of Cyprus, the other of its fleet, Sokolli proudly
replied:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You have doubtless observed our courage after the accident which
happened to our fleet. There is this great difference between our loss and
yours. In capturing a kingdom we have cut off one of your arms, while
you, in destroying our fleet, have merely shorn our beard. A limb cut
off cannot be replaced, but a beard when shorn will grow again in greater
vigour than ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>Terms of peace were concluded. Not only was the
capture of Cyprus confirmed by a formal cession of the
island, but the Republic agreed to pay to the Porte the cost
incurred by its capture, estimated at 300,000 ducats. The
tribute paid by Venice for the island of Zante of 500
ducats was increased to 1,500 ducats. The Republic was
relieved of the annual tribute of 8,000 ducats in respect
of Cyprus. The limits of the possessions of the two Powers
in Dalmatia and Albania were restored to what they had
been before the war. The terms were humiliating to
Venice; they could not have been worse if the battle of
Lepanto had never been fought.</p>

<p>The rapid restoration of its fleet by the Porte gave fresh
evidence of its vital power and its unsurpassed resources.
For a long time to come the Ottoman navy, supported by the
piratical contingents from its Barbary dependents, held a
virtual supremacy in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of peace between Venice and the
Porte, Don John, in October 1573, commanded a Spanish
fleet in an expedition against Tunis, which, as above stated,
had been captured by Ouloudj on behalf of the Turks.
The task of Don John was the more easy as the Turks
had not succeeded in capturing the citadel, which was still
in the possession of its Spanish garrison. He had no
difficulty in defeating the few Turks who were in possession
of the city of Tunis. He showed no disposition to
restore to his throne the Sultan Hamid. This miserable
creature appeared at Tunis and claimed to be reinstated
there. But the Spaniards would have nothing to do with
him. He was deported to Naples.</p>

<p>Don John, having effected his object, departed to Spain,
leaving at Tunis a mixed garrison of eight thousand Italians
and Spaniards. When news of this capture reached Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>stantinople,
Sokolli and Ouloudj were greatly incensed.
In 1574 a fleet of two hundred and sixty galleys and
galleasses with forty thousand men was sent out, under
command of Ouloudj, who made short work of the Spanish
and Italian garrison at Tunis, and recaptured the province,
and finally annexed it to the Turkish Empire. This probably
could not have been effected if Venice had remained
in alliance with Spain, but alone the latter was not able
to meet the Ottoman fleet in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In 1574 Selim died under the influence of drink, and
was succeeded by his son, Murad III, as much a nullity
as regards public affairs as his father. Sokolli remained
as Grand Vizier till his death, four years later, by the
hands of an assassin, but with diminishing power, owing
to the intrigues of the Sultan’s harem, which eventually
contrived his end.</p>

<p>In 1578, the last year of Sokolli’s vizierate, war again
broke out with Persia, and a great army was sent to Asia,
under command of Mustapha, the conqueror of Cyprus.
It began by invading Georgia, then under a native Christian
prince in close alliance with, if not under the subjection
of, Persia. Mustapha had no difficulty in conquering
Georgia, and in occupying the adjacent Persian provinces
of Azerbijan, Loristan, and Scherhezol. He penetrated to
Dhagestan, on the Caspian. The war was continued under
Sokolli’s successors for some years with varying fortune.
It was not till 1590 that a treaty of peace was concluded
with Persia, under which these provinces were ceded to
the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this brief narrative that the acquisitions
of the Ottoman Empire during the twelve years when
the Grand Vizier Sokolli was virtually its ruler were very
great and important. They included the island of Cyprus,
the province of Tunis, the kingdom of Georgia, the
provinces taken from Persia, and the Yemen, in Arabia.
These, with one exception, were the last acquisitions of
the Ottoman Empire. The exception was that of the island
of Crete, which was not attacked by the Turks till sixty-seven
years later, in 1645, and was not finally conquered
till 1668. But by this time the Ottoman Empire had
begun to shrink at the hands of its enemies in other
directions. It may be concluded, therefore, that the last
year of the vizierate of Sokolli, 1578, and not the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
year of Solyman’s reign, was the zenith of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<p>The Empire was by this time extended from the centre
of Hungary in the north to the Persian Gulf and the
Soudan in the south, from the Caspian Sea and the borders
of Persia in the east to the province of Oran in Africa
in the west. It included nearly the whole of the southern
shores of the Mediterranean, except that of Morocco, and
all the shores of the Black Sea and the Red Sea. All
the islands of the Ægean Sea except Crete belonged to it.
These territories were inhabited by twenty different races.
Their population has been variously estimated at thirty
millions and upwards. Many of the Greek cities at that
time existing in Asia Minor were still very populous, in
spite of the massacres which had taken place when they
were captured by the Turks. It is probable that the population
of Asia Minor, of Syria, and of Mesopotamia was
much larger than it is at the present time. That of
Bulgaria, Greece, and Macedonia was also greater than it
was in modern times before their emancipation from Turkish
rule. After the death of Sokolli there ensued an era when
misgovernment and corruption played havoc with the Empire,
and a process of shrinkage began which extended over
three centuries, the exact opposite to its growth in the previous
three centuries.</p>

<p>It should here be noted that although the Sultans were
autocrats in the full sense of the term, there existed in
practice some ultimate check on their misdeeds. The Mufti,
as the chief interpreter of the sacred law of Islam, had
the right and power to declare whether any act of the
Sultan, or any proposed act by any other person, was in
accord with or opposed to such law. As the Mufti could
be deposed by the Sultan and then be put to death, this
power could be very rarely used by him. But when outbreaks
occurred on the part of the Janissaries and reached
a point when the deposition of the Sultan was demanded,
the Mufti, as a rule, was asked for his opinion. It will
be seen that of the twenty-five Sultans after Solyman eleven
were deposed, and in almost every case the Mufti gave
his legal sanction. The Janissaries may have been very
lawless, but they were not the less a salutary check on
the Sultans. With one possible exception the depositions
were well deserved. It should be noted that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
also a check on the Sultans in the Divan, which was composed
of the four viziers and many other functionaries,
military, civil, legal, and religious. It met once or twice
a week and discussed matters of State. Till the time of
Solyman the Sultan presided, but he gave up this practice.
In the absence of the Sultan the Grand Vizier presided.
In the reign of the degenerate Sultans the Divan often played
an important part.</p>

<h2><small>XII</small><br /><br />

THE RULE OF SULTANAS<br />

<small>1578-1656</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the death of Sokolli many years elapsed before
another Grand Vizier was able to wield the power of the
State, in place of the weak and incompetent Sultans who
succeeded to the throne. The supreme power fell into the
hands of women of the Sultan’s harem. For a time the
chief influence lay with the Sultana Baffo, a Venetian lady
of the noble family of that name, who had been captured
when young by a corsair and sold as a slave to the harem
of Sultan Murad III. She was a very clever and
ambitious, as well as a beautiful woman, and for a time
Murad was devoted to her charms to the exclusion of
other inmates of his harem. But his mother, the Sultana
Validé, jealous of Baffo’s exclusive influence in politics,
contrived to draw Murad’s affection from her by tempting
him with two other very beautiful slaves. Later, the lady
who presided over the harem and her assistant improved
on this method by procuring for the Sultan a succession
of beautiful slaves, in such numbers that the price of this
ware rose enormously in the slave market.</p>

<p>Murad, under the influence of these attractions, devoted
himself wholly to voluptuous life in his harem. He became
the father of one hundred and three children, of whom
forty-seven survived him. The Sultana Baffo, the mother
of his eldest son, though she had lost her charm for him
as a mistress, continued to influence him in public affairs
by her wit and cleverness, sharing it, however, with the
other ladies referred to. After the death of the Sultana
Validé, the Sultana Baffo succeeded in regaining much
of her earlier and exclusive influence. She retained the same
authority over her son Mahomet III, who succeeded his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
father in 1595. It resulted, therefore, that this lady, for
twenty-eight years, exercised the greatest power in the State.
Mahomet was as much a nullity in public affairs as his
father. He signalized his accession to the throne by putting
to death his nineteen brothers. He thought apparently
that this holocaust shed some lustre on these unfortunate
princes, for he accorded to them a State funeral. They
were followed to their graves by all the high dignitaries
of the State, and were buried beside their father. Six
favourite slaves of the eldest of these princes, who might
be expected to give birth to future claimants to the throne,
were sewn up in sacks and were flung into the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>Mahomet was the last Sultan who was allowed before
his accession to have some experience in public affairs as
governor of a province. Thenceforward it was the practice
for reigning Sultans to immure their heirs in a building
in the Seraglio, at Constantinople, known as the Cage, where
they were allowed to have no intercourse with the outer
world, and could have no experience, or even knowledge,
of public affairs, and which they only left either to reign
as Sultans or to be put to death. It has been suggested
by some writers that this treatment of the heirs to the
Ottoman throne was the main cause of the lamentable
degeneracy of the Othman dynasty. It must undoubtedly
have contributed to this, but it should be noticed that the
three Sultans, Selim II, Murad III, and Mahomet III, who
had not been subjected to this debasing treatment, and had
been governors of provinces before their accession, were
quite as worthless and incompetent as any of their successors.</p>

<p>Mahomet, after eight years of a vacuous reign, was
succeeded by his son Achmet, who reigned for fourteen
years. He was as incompetent to rule as his two
predecessors. He fell under the influence of other
ladies of his harem. The Sultana Baffo was ignored and
lost her power. On the death of Achmet, in 1617, he
was succeeded not by his eldest son but by his brother
Mustapha, a lunatic. Achmet had spared his brother’s life
on account of his lunacy. Mustapha, therefore, by virtue of
the law of succession, succeeded, but he was deposed after
a few months, and was followed on the throne by Othman II,
the son of Achmet, who showed some greater capacity.
In his short reign, however, of four years he incurred the
disfavour of the Janissaries, who insisted on his deposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and death. The lunatic Mustapha was then reinstated on
the throne, and was again deposed, after a few months.
He was succeeded by Murad IV, a lad under twelve years.
Till he came to years of discretion his mother, the Sultana
Validé, who was a clever woman, virtually ruled. It will
be shown later that Murad was of very different type to
his six predecessors. On coming of age he emancipated
himself from the influence of the harem, and was the
last of his dynasty who was a warrior and who personally
led his army in the field. His rule lasted for only eight
years. On his death, in 1640, he was succeeded by his
brother Ibrahim II, a worthless voluptuary, during whose
reign of another eight years the harem recovered its influence.
He was followed by Mahomet IV, and for eight more
years the rule of the harem was maintained. From this
brief narrative it will appear that from the death of Sokolli
in 1578 till 1656, a period of seventy-eight years, during
which seven Sultans occupied the throne, the supreme power
in the State was exercised by women of the harem, with
the exception of the eight years of the reign of Sultan
Murad IV. For twenty-eight of these years the Sultana
Baffo, and later other ladies less known to fame, were
virtually the rulers of the Empire. Grand Viziers were
made and unmade at the will of these ladies, with occasional
intervention of the Janissaries. They seldom held
the office for more than a year. The Sultana Baffo was
a grasping and avaricious woman. Under her evil influence,
and later that of other ladies of the harem, the
system of the sale of offices was greatly extended and
became universal throughout the Empire for all appointments,
high and low.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the Grand Vizier Roostem, in
Solyman’s reign, first introduced the system of requiring
payments from persons appointed as governors of provinces
and to other high civil posts; but the sums were fixed
and definite, and were paid into the treasury of the State,
and the system was not extended to the army. The payments
now became arbitrary and universal, and were extended
to appointments in the army. The Sultan himself
was not above taking a part in this plunder, and the ladies
of the harem had also their full share. Grand Viziers
only succeeded in retaining their posts by large payments
to the Sultan and his entourage, male and female.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>Von Hammer, on the authority of the historian Ali,
tells the story that a favourite of the Sultan, one Schemsi
Pasha, who was descended from a family formerly reigning
over a province of Asia Minor, on the borders of
the Black Sea, which had been dispossessed by an early
Ottoman Sultan, on coming from an interview with the
Sultan, Murad III, exclaimed with a joyous air: “At last I
have revenged myself on the House of Othman, for I have
now persuaded it to prepare for its own downfall!” When
asked how he had done that, he replied: “By persuading
the Sultan to share in the sale of his own favours. It
is true that I placed a tempting bait before him. Forty
thousand ducats make no trifling sum. From this time
forth the Sultan sets the example of corruption, and
corruption will destroy the Empire.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>As a result of this evil practice of the sale of offices,
the whole system of government throughout the Empire,
from top to bottom, was infected with bribery and corruption.
The judges, equally with other officers, were corrupt,
and gave their judgments to the highest bidder. Criminals
of the vilest kind who could bribe the judges were allowed
to go free. All confidence in the administration of the
law was destroyed. All officers in the State, from the
highest to the lowest, held their posts at the will of those
who appointed them, and were liable to be superseded at
any moment. Having paid large sums for these posts, it
was necessary for them to make hay while the sun shone,
and to recoup themselves for their outlay by exactions
on those below them, and by plundering the people in
their districts.</p>

<p>The army being no longer exempt from this pernicious
system, officers were appointed or promoted, not because
they were efficient, but because they had the longest purses.
The discipline of the army was therefore relaxed. There
was also great dissatisfaction throughout the service
because the soldiers were paid in debased coins. The
garrisons of such frontier fortresses as Buda and Tabriz
broke out in revolt. The Janissaries got out of hand.
There were conflicts between them and the Spahis. The
Janissaries frequently insisted on the dismissal, and even
on the execution, of viziers and other ministers of State, and
the craven Sultans and the ladies of their harems had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>consent. There was rebellion in Transylvania, Moldavia,
and Wallachia. The Christians of the Lebanon rose against
their oppressors, the Turks. Brigandage increased to a
lamentable extent in other parts of the Empire.</p>

<p>The ladies of the harem, it would seem, were not favourable
to war. The Sultana Baffo, being a Venetian by
birth, averted war with that Republic for many years.
Peace was also made with Austria and was maintained for
some years. But in 1593, when Transylvania and Wallachia
were in rebellion, Austria and Hungary were induced by
sympathy for their people to declare war against the Porte.
Their army, under command of the Emperor Maximilian
and Count Pfalfi, the Hungarian general, marched to the
Danube, capturing on their way Gran, Pesth, Bucharest,
and other strongholds of the Turks. They then crossed
the Danube and marched to Varna.</p>

<p>There was the greatest consternation at Constantinople
at the loss of so many strongholds and the defeat of the
Turkish armies. There was a general demand that
the Sultan himself, the incompetent Mahomet, should
endeavour to restore confidence to the Turkish soldiers,
by putting himself at the head of them, as his predecessors
had done in past times. He was urged to unfurl the
standard of the Prophet, and to appeal to the religious
fervour and fanaticism of the army. Mahomet was most
unwilling to adopt this course. He preferred to remain
in the Seraglio at Constantinople. The Sultana Baffo,
fearing that her influence might be lost if her son was
out of her sight, backed his refusal to march. On the
other hand, his preceptor, the historian Seadeddin, who
had great influence over him, made every effort in the
opposite direction. At last the Janissaries refused to go
to the front unless their Padishah led them, and Mahomet,
much against his will, was compelled to put himself at
the head of his army. The sacred standard of the Prophet
and his mantle, a most prized relic, were brought out
for the occasion. With much pomp the Ottomans marched
northwards to meet the invaders. The Austrians and
Hungarians fell back at the approach of this great army
of Turks. They abandoned all the fortresses they had
captured in Bulgaria. They recrossed the Danube. The
two armies at last came into conflict on the plain of
Cerestes, in Hungary, on the 24th of October, 1596,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
where a memorable battle took place, extending over three
days.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Mahomet took any part in the
direction of his army. The Grand Vizier was virtually
in command. The second in command was Cicala, an
Italian by birth who had embraced Islam, a most brave
and resolute soldier, greatly favoured by the ladies of
the harem. The Sultan, however, was present in the field,
surrounded by his bodyguard. The sacred banner of the
Prophet was unfurled and roused, it was said, the fervour
of the Turkish soldiers. On the first day the Turks met
with a reverse, and a division of their army was defeated.
A council of war was held, at which Mahomet expressed
his wish to retreat and to avoid further battle. Seadeddin
stoutly opposed this. “It has never been seen or heard
of,” he said, “that a Padishah of the Ottomans turned
his back upon the enemy without the direst necessity.”
Mahomet then suggested that he himself should withdraw
from the battle, and that the Grand Vizier, Hassan
Pasha, should take command of the army. “This is
no affair for pashas,” said Seadeddin, “the presence
of the Padishah is indispensably necessary.” It was
decided to continue the battle in the presence of the
Sultan.</p>

<p>The second day was no better for the Ottomans than
the first. On the third day, October 26th, the two main
armies came into closer quarters. The Hungarians, under
Count Pfalfi, attacked the Ottoman artillery in flank and
captured all the guns. The battle seemed to be irretrievably
lost. The Sultan, seated on a tall camel, surrounded by
his bodyguard, watched the rout of his army. He wished
to fly while there was time. He was dissuaded again by
Seadeddin, who quoted a verse from the Koran: “It is
patience which wins victory, and joy succeeds to sorrow.”
The Sultan, wrapping the Prophet’s mantle round him,
consented to remain on the field.</p>

<p>The Austrians now charged the Ottoman camp. The
Imperial soldiers, breaking their ranks, devoted themselves
to plunder. At this point Cicala, at the head of a large
body of irregular cavalry, which had taken no part so
far in the battle, charged with irresistible force the scattered
host of the Christians. They carried everything before
them. The Austrians, in their turn, were driven from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
field. Maximilian and Sigismund were compelled to fly
for their lives.</p>

<p>The Ottomans, as a result of this gallant charge, regained
all that they had lost. Thirty thousand Austrians and
Hungarians perished. Ninety-five of their guns were
captured. The camp and the treasure of the Archduke
were taken. Never was a more complete and unexpected
victory. No thanks, however, were due to the Sultan.
There can be no doubt that if he had acted on his own
impulse and had fled, the battle would have been lost.
He was a timid spectator of the conflict, and of much
the same use as the sacred standard and the cloak of
the Prophet. The victory was undoubtedly due to the
courage of Cicala and the splendid charge of his cavalry,
and to the determination of Seadeddin in compelling his
master the Sultan, against his will, to remain on the field
of battle.</p>

<p>No more important battle had taken place beyond the
Danube since that of Mohacz in the time of Mahomet II.
If the victory had resulted to the Christians, the whole
of the Ottoman possessions north of the Danube would have
been lost. The Christian army, under Maximilian, would
again have crossed that river and have advanced into
Bulgaria and Macedonia, and the dismemberment of the
Ottoman Empire might have been precipitated by two or
three centuries.</p>

<p>The craven Sultan returned to Constantinople immediately
after the battle. He received there a great ovation
for the victory due to Cicala. Never again did he lead
an army on the field. He devoted himself thenceforth
to a voluptuous life in his harem. The government of the
Empire remained in the hands of the Sultana Validé.</p>

<p>Cicala, as a reward for his successful charge, was immediately
promoted to be Grand Vizier. It was a most unfortunate
selection. He treated with great severity the
Ottoman troops who had misbehaved at the battle of
Ceresties. He accused them of cowardice. He inflicted
summary punishment on their leaders. Thirty thousand
of the soldiers, mostly belonging to Asia Minor, dispersed
and returned to their homes, spreading disaffection and
rebellion in their several districts.</p>

<p>After this signal victory war of a desultory character was

other getting the better of it in the capture and recapture of
fortresses. In 1606 peace was arrived at. A treaty was concluded
between the two Powers at Silvatorok, which was, on
the whole, unfavourable to the Ottomans. Transylvania was
practically freed from their rule. They were confirmed
in the possession of one-half of Hungary, but the other
half was freed from tribute. The fortresses of Gran, Erlau,
and Gradiscka were secured to Ottoman possession, Raab
and Komorn to Austria. The annual payment of 30,000
ducats by Austria, which the Turks regarded as a tribute,
was also to cease, but a lump sum of 200,000 ducats was
to be paid to the Porte.</p>

<p>By the surrender of its claims on Transylvania the
Ottoman Empire in Europe entered upon a course of
shrinkage, which thenceforth, up to the present time, has
been the normal course of events.</p>

<p>This decadence was soon to be illustrated in another
direction. War had again broken out with Persia, and
the Turks sustained a series of defeats. In 1618 peace
was patched up for a time, by the terms of which all the
provinces which had been captured under Murad III and
Mahomet III were ceded again to Persia, and the boundaries
between the two Empires were restored to what they had
been under Selim II. Meanwhile, as a result of misgovernment,
the Turkish Empire was going headlong to
ruin. We have a very authoritative account of the
deplorable condition into which it had fallen at this period
in the reports of Sir Thomas Roe, who was sent as the
first British Ambassador to the Porte by James I.
Queen Elizabeth had already, a few years previously,
entered into correspondence with the Porte, and had urged
the Sultan to join in a naval alliance in the Mediterranean
against Philip II, who was then threatening to invade
England. The reply of the Porte was friendly, but
nothing more.</p>

<p>In 1622 Sir Thomas Roe was sent on a mission, mainly
for the purpose of protesting against the piratical destruction
of British commerce by corsairs from Algiers and
Tunis. He remained at Constantinople for five years, and
succeeded in obtaining promises of redress from the Porte.
The Pasha of Algiers was recalled and a successor was
appointed. But apparently this had very little effect in
abating piracy. The reports of Sir Thomas Roe are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
full of descriptions of the misery of the inhabitants of
Turkey, of symptoms of decay, and of the falling grandeur
of the Empire.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All the territory of the Grand Seignior [he says] is dispeopled for want
of pasture and by reason of violent oppression—so much so that, in the
best parts of Greece and Anatolia, a man may ride three or four, or
sometimes six, days and not find a village to feed him or his horse,
whereby the revenue is so lessened that there is not wherewithal to pay
the soldiers and to maintain the Court. It may be patched up for a while
out of the Treasury, and by exactions which are now onerous upon the
merchants and labouring men to satisfy the harpies.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>I can say no more than that the disease works internally that must ruin
this Empire; we daily expect more changes and effusion of blood. The
wisest men refuse to sit at the helm, and fools will soon run themselves
and others upon the rocks.</p>

<p>This State for sixteen months since the death of Othman hath been a
stage of variety; the soldiers usurping all government, placing and
displacing <i>more vulg.</i> as the wynd of humour or dissatisfaction
moved them. In this kind I have seen three Emperors, seven Grand
Viziers, two Capitan Pashas, five Agas of the Janissaries, and, in proportion,
as many changes of governors in all the provinces, every new Vizier
making use of his time displacing those in possession and selling their
favours to others.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In another passage he points out that the hope of booty
was the main motive for war and invasion by the Turks:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Turkish soldier is not only apt but desirous to make invasion
because all things are prey and all kinds of licence allowed to them; and
his hope is more upon booty and prisoners than upon conquest. Every
boy or girl is to them magazine and brings them the best of merchandise
and worth 100 dollars, so that every village is to them a magazine and
they return rich.... But I am persuaded versâ vice if they were invaded
and the war were brought to their doors they would be found the
weakest, unprovided and undisciplined enemy in the world.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The pirates of Algiers have cast off all obedience to the Empire, not
only upon the sea where they are masters, but presuming to do many
insolences even upon the land and in the best parts of the Grand
Seignior.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There can be no doubt that at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, when Sir Thomas Roe wrote these
dispatches, the Ottoman Empire was in a condition of un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>paralleled
disorganization, and its various races were in
a state of untold misery, owing in part to the want of strong
men at its head, and in greater part to the system of
corruption which had infected every branch of its administration.
If at this time any neighbouring Power had been
in a position to attack it, the Empire would not have been
able to offer resistance. But Spain, after the reign of
Philip II, was almost as decadent as Turkey. Germany
was distracted by internal religious wars and was unable
to concentrate on external foes, while Russia had not as
yet developed a position which made her formidable to the
Turks.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that there was a break in the
disastrous rule of the harem when Murad IV came of age
and was able to take the reins of government from the hands
of his mother. The Sultana Validé was a very clever
woman, with excellent intentions, and practically ruled the
State during his minority. But she was not equal to the
task of coping with the grave difficulties of the time. The
Empire was going to the bad in all directions. The Persians,
taking advantage of the confusion in Turkey, declared
war and successfully invaded the provinces of Erivan and
Bagdad. The two Barbary provinces of Algiers and Tunis
were asserting independence. They engaged in piratical
attacks on the commerce of the allies of the Porte, and
were negotiating separate treaties with them. The internal
condition of the Empire became worse than ever. There
were frequent outbreaks of Janissaries, who imposed their
will on the Sultana.</p>

<p>In 1632, Murad, on reaching the age of twenty-one,
took command of the State, and soon showed that he was
of very different fibre from his six incapable predecessors.
His first experience was an outbreak of the Janissaries,
who demanded that the Grand Vizier and sixteen other
prominent officials should be executed. Murad was compelled
to yield. But he felt deeply the humiliation of his
surrender and was determined to avenge it. He gathered
round him a faithful band of Spahis, and suddenly, when
it was least expected, dealt with the leaders of the Janissaries
by putting them to death. This had the effect of cowing
that mutinous body. He then devoted himself to the task
of purging the State of corrupt and unjust officials of all
ranks. He pursued this task with most ruthless energy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
On the slightest suspicion officials in the highest positions
were secretly put to death by his orders, and their bodies
were flung into the Bosphorus. He became a terror
to evildoers of all ranks. But he also became bloodthirsty
and callous of life in the process. Brutal as were
his deeds, they had the effect of restoring order in the
State and discipline in the army. Throughout the length
and breadth of the Empire his dominant will made itself
felt, and his authority as Sultan was soon completely
re-established.</p>

<p>Murad showed himself equally vigorous and competent
as a general. His effective reign, after taking over the
government from his mother, did not extend over more than
eight years. During this time he personally led two expeditions
against the Shah of Persia, each of them occupying
two years. In the first of them he conquered Erivan.
In the second he recaptured the city of Bagdad, after a
most desperate resistance by the Persians. Of the garrison
of twenty thousand men only six hundred survived.
The Ottoman army was then allowed to sack the city, and
thirty thousand of the inhabitants were massacred. The
whole province was restored to the Ottoman rule. More
than eighty years passed before another war took place with
Persia.</p>

<p>In these campaigns Murad showed immense vigour. He
marched at the head of his army and shared with the soldiers
their hardships. His saddle was his pillow at night. There
was no pitched battle with the Persians. The campaigns
consisted of sieges and captures of fortresses. On his return
to the capital after the second campaign, in 1639, Murad
received a great popular ovation. He died soon after, in
1640, from fever, aggravated by intemperance, to which he
was addicted. When he was on the point of death he gave
orders for the execution of his brother, Ibrahim, the only
surviving male of the descendants of Othman. Ibrahim
had been immured in ‘the Cage’ during the lifetime of
his brother. He was quite unfit to rule the Empire, and
Murad must have well known this. It was surmised that
Murad preferred to go down in history as the last Sultan
of the Othman race rather than hand over the throne to
such an incapable successor. Others thought that he intended
his last and favourite Grand Vizier to be his successor.
His mother, the Sultana Validé, with the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
of saving the life of her second son, Ibrahim, feigned to
carry out Murad’s order. She sent a message to the dying
Sultan that Ibrahim had been put to death in accordance
with his instructions. Murad, it is said, when he heard of this
“grinned a horrible and ghastly smile and then expired.”</p>

<p>It may well have been that those who wished for the
destruction of the Ottoman Empire regarded with complaisance
the failure of Murad’s intention of putting an end
to the Othman dynasty. It was obviously impossible that
Sultans of the type of those who had succeeded the great
Solyman could for long hold the Empire intact. A new
dynasty, founded by an ambitious vizier, or some other bold
adventurer, might have invigorated the Empire and have
long delayed its dismemberment. But <i>Dîs aliter visum
est</i>.</p>

<p>If Murad’s intention to put his brother to death was
prompted by the conviction that Ibrahim was unfit to rule
the Empire, he was fully justified by subsequent events.
In his short reign of eight years Ibrahim succeeded in
undoing all the good which Murad had effected by his
ruthless vigour. He proved to be a degenerate, whose
original evil nature had been worsened by many years of
immurement and constant dread of death at the hands of
his brother. He was as bloodthirsty as Murad, without
the same motive of restoring discipline in the army and order
and justice throughout the Empire. He was also cowardly
and mean. He wasted the resources of the State, which
had been wisely accumulated by Murad, in self-indulgence
and in gratifying the caprices of his harem. He was the
most confirmed debauchee of the long line of the Ottoman
Sultans. The Sultana Validé pandered to his passions
by presenting to him every Friday a new female slave.
By this means she obtained full influence over him and
used it in every case to the great detriment of the State.
Every abuse and evil which Murad had checked grew
apace, and the Turkish Empire, so far as internal affairs
were concerned, entered on a new course of decadence. The
rule of the harem again prevailed, without any motive but
that of gratifying the caprices of its inmates. Disaffection
and rebellion spread among the Janissaries and Spahis,
and also among the ulemas and all classes of people at
Constantinople. A conspiracy was formed to get rid of
Ibrahim. It was supported by the main body of ulemas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
At a meeting of the conspirators the charge against Ibrahim
was formulated as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Padishah has ruined the Ottoman world by pillage and tyranny.
Women wield the sovereignty. The treasury cannot satiate their expense.
The subjects are ruined. The armies of the infidels are besieging towns
on the frontiers. Their fleets blockade the Dardanelles.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was determined to dethrone Ibrahim and to replace
him by his son Mahomet, a lad of seven years of age. The
Sultana Validé did her best to shield her son from the
threatened blow, but she was ultimately induced to give
her consent to his deposition. A large body of Janissaries
then invaded the palace and insisted on Ibrahim appearing
before them. They announced to him the decision to
depose him. He was compelled to submit and was conducted
to prison. The question was then submitted to
the Mufti, “Is it lawful to dethrone and put to death a
Padishah who confers all the posts of dignity in the Empire,
not on those who are worthy of them, but on those who
have bought them for money?” The Mufti replied by a
<i>fetva</i> in the laconic word “Yes.” There was a threat of
an <i>émeute</i> among the Spahis in favour of Ibrahim. He
was promptly put to death and his son Mahomet IV was
installed as Sultan.</p>

<p>The eight years of Ibrahim’s reign, however, were not
without some importance as regards the external affairs of
the Empire. They showed that there were still some capable
men in the service of the Sultan. In 1641 an expedition
was fitted out for the recapture of the important city of
Azoff, which of late years had fallen into the hands of the
Cossacks. It was a failure and met with a reverse. In
the next year a much larger force was sent out, and was
supported by a hundred thousand Tartars from the Crimea.
It succeeded in its object. The Cossacks, before surrendering
the city, destroyed all its fortifications and burnt
the town. The Turks rebuilt it and left a garrison of
twenty-six thousand in this important frontier fortress.</p>

<p>In 1644 another expedition was fitted out against the
island of Crete, which then belonged to the Republic of
Venice. It had been bought many years previously from
the Marquis of Montserrat, to whom it had been allotted as
his share in the spoil of the Greek Empire, after the
capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that a fleet of merchant vessels, on their way
from Constantinople to Egypt, was captured by corsairs
from Malta, who sought shelter for a time for themselves
and their prizes in one of the ports of Crete. The Sultan
was greatly incensed at this, the more so as some of the
captured vessels belonged to one of the eunuchs of his
harem. His first design was to send a fleet to attack Malta,
but he was dissuaded from this course. He decided, as an
alternative, to attack Crete, although the Porte was at peace
with Venice, and the Republic was willing to make amends
for the violation of its neutrality by the Maltese corsairs.</p>

<p>A fleet was thereupon fitted out, in 1645, ostensibly to
attack Malta, but with sealed orders to divert its course
when at sea to Crete. It consisted of a hundred and four
vessels carrying upwards of fifty thousand men. The fleet,
under the above orders, steered for Crete, and made a
sudden attack on Canea, one of the chief ports of the island.
Having captured this city and also Retino, the army was
landed. It overran the whole island and invested Candia,
its chief fortress and capital. A memorable siege then
commenced. It lasted for nearly twenty-five years. The
Republic of Venice made desperate efforts to save the city.
It was not supported by the native Greek population of
the island, who hated their Venetian rulers, and were not
unwilling to exchange them for Ottomans.</p>

<p>While the Porte was thus engaged in the endeavour to
add to its domain at the expense of the Republic of Venice,
it was incurring a very serious shrinkage of Empire in the
Mediterranean, along the northern coast of Africa. Historians
agree in assigning to the middle of the seventeenth
century the virtual severance from Ottoman rule of the two
Barbary States of Algiers and Tunis. It is not possible to
fix a precise date in either case, for the process of amputation
was slow and was spread over some years, and long after the
Sultan had practically ceased to exercise any real power over
these dependencies the semblance and form of suzerainty
was maintained. The main cause for the loss of these
provinces was the practice which had grown up, under the
corrupt administration of the Porte, of selling the posts of
governors of them to the highest bidders in money. In
place of men of energy and of capacity, able to control the
unruly elements of mutinous soldiers and disaffected Moors
and Arabs, governors were appointed under a system of pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>chase
who were quite incapable of performing the duties of
their office, and who merely thought of filling their pockets
and recouping themselves for their outlay. The practice then
arose for the Janissaries and other Ottoman soldiers forming
the garrisons of Algiers and Tunis to elect their own
chiefs. The appointments of these men, Deys, as they were
called, were for a time submitted to the Sultan for approval
or veto, but later this form was discontinued, and the Deys
elected by the soldiery became the real dominant authorities
in these States, and eventually superseded in form, as well
as in substance, the feeble pashas sent nominally as
governors from Constantinople. Virtual independence was
thus achieved. Both States provided themselves with fleets
of powerful war vessels, which roamed over the Mediterranean
and the Atlantic as far as the coasts of Ireland and
Madeira, preying upon the commerce of all countries, irrespective
of whether they were at war with the Porte or
not. They were, in fact, pirates. The captured crews were
employed as slaves in the bagnios of Algiers and Tunis.
The best evidence of the actual, though not yet of the
formal, independence of these Barbary States was that other
Powers sent their fleets to attack and bombard them, and
to destroy, if possible, their pirate craft, without declaring
war against the suzerain power, the Porte. Thus, as early
as 1617 a French fleet, under Admiral Beaulieu, made
an attack on the Algerian fleet of forty vessels of from two
hundred to four hundred tons, and destroyed many of
them. In 1620 a British fleet, under Sir Richard Mansel,
in retaliation for the capture of no less than four hundred
British merchant ships in the previous five years, made
a similar attack on Algiers, without, however, much result.
In 1655, another British fleet, commanded by Admiral
Blake, under orders from Protector Cromwell, bombarded
Tunis, and destroyed a great part of its fleet, and having
effected this proceeded to Algiers. There was much consternation
there, and the captives of British birth were given
up without a struggle. In both these cases there was no
declaration of war against the Porte, and no offence was
taken by the Sultan at the action of England.</p>

<p>In 1663 the British Government made a treaty with
the Sultan empowering it to attack and punish the
Algerines without being charged with a breach of amity
with the Porte. It frequently availed itself of this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and many naval attacks were made on these nests of
pirates, without, however, very effectual results. In some
of its naval operations in the Ægean Sea the Porte received
assistance from the fleets of these two Barbary States.
But this was entirely at the discretion of their virtual rulers
and was not considered obligatory on them. For our
present purpose, it is sufficient to point out that the States
became virtually independent of the Ottoman Empire about
the year 1650. In the case of Algiers this independence
continued till the State was conquered and annexed by
France in 1830. In Tunis the same process took place,
with the difference that an hereditary Beyship was eventually
formed under a Greek adventurer whose descendants retained
power there till 1881, when the French invaded the
province and eventually annexed it to France.</p>

<p>Ibrahim was succeeded by his son, Mahomet IV. He
reigned for thirty-nine years. During the first eight of
these there was chaos in the Empire. The government
remained in the hands of the harem. The position was
aggravated by fierce dissension in that institution. There
were two rival parties, the one led by the ex-Sultana
Validé, the mother of the late Sultan, who was loath to part
with the power she had acquired during her son’s reign,
the other by the mother of the new Sultan, Torchan by
name. Both of them had their supporters among the
Janissaries and Spahis, with the result that there were frequent
disorders and encounters in the streets of the capital.
Grand Viziers were made and deposed with startling rapidity,
as one or other of these parties prevailed. Outbreaks
occurred in many parts of the Empire and there was no one
with sufficient authority to cope with them. The dispute
between the two ladies was eventually settled by the murder
of the elder one. Meanwhile it was fortunate for the Empire
that Austria was so exhausted by thirty years of war in
Germany that she was not able to avail herself of the
opportunity afforded to invade the Ottoman Empire and
recover Hungary and other provinces. But the war with
Venice resulting from the unprovoked attack by Ibrahim
on Crete was continued without intermission. A Venetian
fleet under command of Admiral Macenigo defeated and
destroyed an Ottoman fleet off the Dardanelles and took
possession of the islands of Lemnos and Tenedos. It
blockaded the Dardanelles. Strange to say, this did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
put a stop to the siege of Candia by the Ottomans. This
was maintained with pertinacity, but for a long time without
success. Meanwhile anarchy prevailed in the Empire.
Relief most unexpectedly came from the appointment of
a Grand Vizier by Sultana Torchan, by which she made
some amends for her previous misdeeds.</p>

<h2><small>XIII</small><br /><br />

THE KIUPRILI VIZIERS<br />

<small>1656-1702</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this stage, when the ruin of the Empire seemed to
be imminent, owing to the failure of vigour and authority
of so many Sultans, the general corruption of officials,
and the lawlessness and mutinous conduct of the army,
there rose to the front a man, or rather a succession of
men of the same family, who were able to stem the evil
tide and to restore, for a time, the credit and prestige
of the Empire. In the following forty-six years four
members of the Kiuprili family filled the post of Grand
Vizier—not, however, without more than one unfortunate
interregnum. They ruled the Empire in the name of
the incompetent Mahomet and his successor. This advent
of a family was the more notable as in Turkey there
never was any trace of hereditary rank. While the throne
had been filled without a break by members of the
Othman family, who, in the first three hundred years,
deservedly acquired prestige so great that it has survived
a yet longer succession of degenerates, it has never
been supported by an hereditary class of any kind.
The structure of the political and social system of
the Ottoman Turks has always been democratic. The
highest posts in the State, equally with the lowest, were
accessible to all, irrespective of merit, often by mere personal
favour, or even, it would seem, by chance, without
consideration of birth or wealth. The unique exception to
this, where members of the same family rose to the highest
position of the State under the Sultan, was that of the
Kiuprili family.</p>

<p>Mahomet Kiuprili, the first of this remarkable stock,
was of Albanian descent. His grandfather had migrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
to Kiupril, a small town in Amasia, in Asia Minor, whence
the family took their name. Their position must have
been a very humble one, for Mahomet commenced his
career as kitchen-boy in the palace of the Sultan. He
rose to be chief cook and, later, steward and grand falconer,
and thence by favour of the harem was appointed as
governor successively of Damascus, Tripoli, and Jerusalem,
acquiring in all of them the reputation of a just, firm,
and humane ruler. At the full age of seventy, on the
advice of the Sultana Validé, he was finally appointed
Grand Vizier, in spite of the protests of all the pashas,
ulemas, and other officials, who alleged that Kiuprili was
in his dotage, that he could neither read nor write, and
that he was quite incompetent for the post. Never were
experts more mistaken. Kiuprili only consented to take
the post upon the conditions, solemnly swore to by the
Sultana Validé on behalf of her son, who was then only
fifteen years of age, that all his acts as Grand Vizier
would be ratified by the Sultan without examination or
discussion, and that he would have a free hand in the
distribution of other offices and in the award of honours.
He further fortified his position by getting from the Mufti
a <i>fetva</i> sanctioning by anticipation all his measures.</p>

<p>Armed with this authority, Kiuprili entered upon the
work of his high office, and at once proceeded to use his
powers with inflexible firmness and with the utmost severity.
He emulated Sultan Murad IV in his relentless war against
wrongdoers of every class, high and low, throughout the
Empire. There was not the same spirit of cruelty or
bloodthirstiness as in Murad’s case, but there was the
deliberate policy to extirpate abuses by the forcible
removal of those concerned in them. Corrupt officials,
unjust judges, incompetent officers in the army, and
mutinous soldiers were promptly put to death. The same
fate befell those who were suspected of intriguing against
the new Vizier. It was said that during his five years of
office thirty-five thousand persons were executed by his
orders. The number included a great many mutinous
soldiers. The principal executioner at Constantinople
admitted that he had strangled four thousand persons of
some position during this period. Terrible as was this
retribution on wrongdoers of all kinds, there cannot be a
doubt that in the main it was salutary. The effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Kiuprili’s inflexible will and determination was speedily
apparent throughout the Empire. Corruption and injustice
were stayed. Disorders of all kinds were repressed.
Discipline and subordination were restored in the army.</p>

<p>Kiuprili, by his vigorous action, was able to extinguish
the revolts in Asia Minor and elsewhere. He reconstructed
the Ottoman navy, with the result that naval supremacy
was again asserted in the Ægean Sea and the war with
Venice took a favourable turn. The islands of Lemnos
and Tenedos were recovered by the Porte. The siege
of Candia was again prosecuted with the utmost vigour.</p>

<p>Kiuprili practically ruled the Empire with unquestioned
authority for five years, till his death in 1661. In prospect
of that event he obtained from the Sultana Validé and
the Sultan the reversion of the Grand Vizierate for his
son, Ahmed Kiuprili. On his deathbed he is said to have
given to the young Sultan the following heads of advice:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Never to listen to the advice of women.</div>
<div class="line">Never to allow a subject to become too rich.</div>
<div class="line">To keep the treasury of the State well filled.</div>
<div class="line">To be always on horseback and to keep the army on the move.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ahmed Kiuprili, when he succeeded his father as Grand
Vizier in 1661, was only twenty-six years of age. He
has rightly been considered by Turkish historians as the
most eminent in the long list of statesmen of the Ottoman
Empire, with the exception only of Sokolli. He had been
given the best of education by his father, and had early
experience in public affairs as governor of a province.
He had all his father’s inflexible will and firmness, without
carrying them to excess by wholesale executions. For
a year after his accession to power he continued his father’s
régime of severity, but when he felt assured of his position
he relaxed it, and thenceforward his administration was
humane and just. He had most engaging manners, dignified
and modest. He spoke with reserve and without
verbiage. He ruled the Empire for fifteen years, until
his death in 1676. During this time he enjoyed the full
confidence of Sultan Mahomet, who, though he had reached
the age of twenty when Ahmed Kiuprili was appointed
Grand Vizier, and might in due course have taken part in
public affairs, devoted himself wholly to the pleasures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the chase and never interfered with the conduct of affairs
by his great minister.</p>

<p>Ahmed was a most strict observer of the religious
precepts of Islam. In spite of this, he was noted for
his enlightened tolerance of other religions. He abolished
the restrictions against the building of churches by the
Christian subjects of the Porte. He did his best to improve
the condition and lighten the burden of the rayas. His
administration was free from abuses. He gave an example
to all below him by refusing to take money for appointments
to offices or for any administrative acts. He kept
the treasury well filled, in spite of the many wars he
was engaged in. It was, in fact, in the civil administration
of the Empire that his ability and wisdom were chiefly
conspicuous. His military career was chequered, for
though he succeeded in adding to the Empire not a few
important territories, he encountered for the first time in
its history a great and historic defeat at the hands of the
Austrians and a second serious defeat by the Poles.</p>

<p>In 1663 war broke out with Austria, and the Grand
Vizier, in command of an army of a hundred and twenty
thousand men with a hundred and twenty-three guns,
crossed the Danube at Belgrade and marched northwards
to Neuhausel, one of the three most important strongholds
in the hands of the Austrians, which, after a siege of
five weeks, was compelled to surrender. Meanwhile the
Khan of the Crimea, at the head of a horde of irregular
horsemen, overran Moravia, committing the most frightful
devastation and carrying off eighty thousand Christians as
captives for sale as slaves.</p>

<p>After the capture of Neuhausel, Ahmed Kiuprili took
other minor strongholds in the neighbourhood, and then
returned to Belgrade for winter quarters. In the following
year he again issued from Belgrade with his army and
marched to Neuhausel. He then crossed the River Mur
and captured Serivar, and on July 26 he reached
Komorn, on the River Raab, on the frontier of Hungary
and Styria. The Austro-Hungarian army, under the command
of the Comte Montecuculi, a general of great
reputation—an Italian by birth and the rival of Turenne—held
a position on the River Raab not far from Komorn.
It was greatly inferior in numbers to that of the Ottomans.
But since the last great battle between the two Powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
at Cerestes the Austrians had greatly improved in the
quality of their generals and officers and in their armaments.
The discipline of the Ottoman troops was no
longer what it had been, and they had not kept pace in
the improvement in guns.</p>

<p>On August 1, 1664, the two armies met near to the
Convent of St. Gotthard, which gave its name to a memorable
battle. In spite of their great numerical superiority,
the Ottomans met with a severe defeat, largely due to
the charge of heavy cavalry of the Austrians, under the
command of Prince Charles of Lorraine, soon to become
famous as a general. The Turks lost ten thousand men,
many of whom were driven into the River Raab and were
drowned. Thirty thousand of their cavalry, who were
spectators of the battle from the other side of the River
Raab, took to flight when they saw the issue of the battle
and abandoned fifteen guns. The Grand Vizier was able
to draw off the main body of his army without further
loss. The Austrian losses were heavy, and they made
no effort to follow up their victory. The battle, however,
was of supreme importance, for it was the first great
defeat of the Ottomans in the field by the Austrians. It
broke the prestige of the former, which had been unquestioned
since the battle of Mohacz in 1526.</p>

<p>In spite of their victory, the Austrians were willing to
negotiate with the Grand Vizier for terms of peace, and
ten days after the battle a treaty was signed at Vascar,
where the Turks were encamped. It was, in the main,
a renewal of the treaty of Silvatorok. So far as it differed,
it was favourable to the Ottomans. It provided that
Transylvania was to be evacuated by both Austrians and
Turks. It recognized Apafy, whose claims had been maintained
by the latter, as prince of that province, subject
to payment of tribute to the Sultan. Serivar and
Neuhausel were to remain in the hands of the Sultan. Of
seven palatinates occupied by the Ottomans, four were to
remain in their hands and three were to be restored to the
Emperor. Ahmed Kiuprili had every reason to be satisfied
with this treaty. Though defeated in a pitched battle,
he had added to the Empire of the Sultan. He led his
armies into winter quarters again at Belgrade at the end
of October, and on his return to Constantinople received
a popular ovation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>In 1667 Ahmed entered upon another campaign. He
was determined to bring to a successful issue the siege
of Candia, which for so many years had baffled all the
efforts of his predecessors. He landed in the island of
Crete with large reinforcements. The city of Candia was
defended with the utmost tenacity and courage by the
Venetians, under the command of Morosini, later famous
for the conquest of the Morea. Ahmed spent nearly three
years before the city. He urged on the siege with great
engineering skill. The Venetians made every effort to
retain possession of the city and of the island by offers
of large sums of money. Ahmed Kiuprili proudly replied
to these overtures: “We are not money-dealers. We
make war to win Candia, and at no price will we
abandon it.”</p>

<p>In the course of 1669 the prospect of a successful
defence of the city was increased by the arrival of a
French fleet, commanded by the Duc de Noailles, and
having on board the flower of the French nobility and six
thousand soldiers. They were joined later by auxiliary
squadrons of the Pope and the Knights of Malta. The
combined fleet, consisting of seventy vessels, bombarded
the Ottomans from the sea, while the besieged opened fire
on their front. The allies hoped to place the Turks between
two fires and to draw them from the trenches which invested
the city by land. The attack, however, failed owing to
the accidental blowing up of some of the attacking vessels.
This brought confusion into the whole line. A sortie of
the garrison was also unsuccessful. Later, a serious misunderstanding
arose between Morosini and the Duc de
Noailles, which led to the departure of the allied fleet
and the abandonment of the city to its own resources.
The garrison was now reduced to four thousand men
capable of bearing arms. Defence against the overwhelming
forces of the Turks was impossible. Terms of
surrender were agreed to. The siege, which had lasted
for nearly twenty-five years, was brought to an end. Favourable
terms were accorded to Morosini and the garrison.
The whole island fell into the hands of the Ottomans, and
shortly after this a treaty of peace was effected with the
Republic of Venice, which recognized the transfer of Crete,
with the exception of three small ports on its coast, which
were retained for commercial purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>A third war was undertaken in 1672 by Ahmed Kiuprili
against Poland in support of the Cossacks of the Ukraine,
who had risen against their oppressors, the Poles, and had
appealed to the Porte for protection against the invasion
of their country by Sobieski. It was decided by Ahmed
to support these insurgents. An army of six thousand
was sent there, in concert with a much larger force of
Tartars from the Crimea. The Czar of Russia joined
with the King of Poland in protesting against this intervention
of the Porte. The proud answer of the Porte
was:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>God be praised, such is the strength of Islam that the union of Russians
and Poles matters not to us. Our Empire has increased in might since
its origin; nor have all the Christian kings that have leagued against us
been able to pluck a hair from our beard. With God’s grace it shall ever
be so, and our Empire shall endure to the Day of Judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ahmed Kiuprili himself, in a letter written in his own
hand to the Polish envoy, defended his action in terms
which might well have been quoted later when the Christian
subjects of Turkey rose in arms against their oppressors
and claimed the assistance of Russia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Cossacks [he said], a free people, placed themselves under the
Poles, but being unable to endure Polish oppression any longer, they have
sought protection elsewhere, and they are now under the Turkish banner.
If the inhabitants of an oppressed country, in order to obtain deliverance,
implore the aid of a mighty emperor, is it prudent to pursue them in such
an asylum? When the most mighty and most glorious of all emperors is
seen to deliver and succour from their enemies those who are oppressed,
and who ask him for protection, a wise man will know on which side the
blame of breaking peace ought to rest. If, in order to quench the fire
of discord, negotiation is wished for, so let it be. But if the solution of
differences is referred to that keen and decisive judge called ‘the Sword,’
the issue of the strife must be pronounced by God, by whose aid Islam
has for a thousand years triumphed over its foes.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the campaign of 1672, the important city of
Kaminiec, the capital of Podolia, was captured. The King
of Poland then sued for peace, and the treaty of Bucsacs
was agreed to, under which the province of Podolia was
ceded to the Sultan. The treaty, however, was disavowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>by Sobieski and the principal nobles of Poland. They
renewed the war against the Turks. It lasted for four
years. In 1673 the Turkish army, under Ahmed Kiuprili,
met with a crushing defeat from the Poles, under Sobieski,
near Choczim. His camp was surprised. The Wallachians
and Moldavians deserted him on the field and went over
to the enemy. There was great slaughter of the
Turks. In the following year the Turks returned to the
charge, but were again worsted. In 1675 Sobieski, aided
by the Russians, gained another great victory over the
Turks at Lemberg. But in the following year the Turks,
under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, turned the tables
on the Poles. The superior resources of the Turks, under
the able administration of Kiuprili, told at last in their
favour. Sobieski, who had become King of Poland, was
defeated. The whole of Podolia fell into the hands of
the Ottomans. Sobieski was now willing to come to terms.
Under the treaty of Zurawna (October 27, 1676) terms
rather more favourable than those under the repudiated
treaty of Bucsacs were conceded to the Ottomans. Podolia
was ceded to them.</p>

<p>Ahmed Kiuprili died a few days after the signature of
this treaty from the effect of drink. Though he had
incurred severe defeats at the hands of the Austrians and
Poles, he had retrieved them by his persistence and by
the effective use of the resources of the Empire, which
he enlarged by the province of Podolia, the island of
Crete, and the district of Neuhausel and Serinvar, in
Hungary. These entitle him to be ranked among the
makers of the Empire so far as Europe was concerned.
His enlightened administration, his humane and just bearing,
his insistence on equal justice for all, irrespective
of religious creeds, his strict observance of his plighted
faith in public and private affairs, in matters great and
small, his patronage of science and literature, earned for
him a place in the first rank of Turkish statesmen.</p>

<p>It was hoped in many quarters that the Sultan would
appoint as successor to Ahmed Kiuprili his brother, Zadé
Mustapha Kiuprili, who had shown as governor of provinces
that he had many of Ahmed’s high qualities. In an evil
moment Mahomet conferred the post of Grand Vizier on
his son-in-law, a favourite companion in the chase, Kara
Mustapha—the black Mustapha—who was notorious for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
bloodthirsty disposition and his avidity and corruption. This
seems to have been one of the few acts of the Sultan
Mahomet IV where he exercised his royal prerogative, for
as a rule he left everything to his Vizier, when appointed,
and cared for nothing but the pleasures of the chase. A
more unfortunate appointment could not have been made.
Thirteen years elapsed before Zadé Kiuprili was at last invested
with the office. They were years fraught with
disaster to the Empire.</p>

<p>The first military effort of the new Grand Vizier was to
lead an army in 1678 across the Danube into the Ukraine.
He came into conflict there with the Russians as well as
the Poles, and met with a severe defeat. The war,
however, simmered on with varying results till 1681. Peace
was then concluded with Russia, and the Turks gave up
the disputed country.</p>

<p>In 1682 the population in that part of Hungary which
was under the rule of the Emperor Leopold revolted against
his bigoted tyranny. Kara Mustapha thought that this
afforded an opportunity for attacking Austria. He seems
also to have been inflated with ambition to create a kingdom
for himself. He collected an enormous army at
Adrianople, and in the spring of the following year, 1683,
he crossed the Danube at the head of two hundred and
seventy-five thousand men, without counting a horde of
irregular Tartars and camp followers. He met with little
resistance in his march northwards till he reached the
walls of Vienna at the head of two hundred thousand men.
The Emperor, on his part, was very ill-provided with troops
to meet this enormous host of invaders. He had no more
than thirty-five thousand men under arms. Of these, eleven
thousand were left to garrison Vienna, and the main body
was quite insufficient to meet the Turks in the field. In
his peril the Emperor appealed for aid to Sobieski, the
King of Poland. The Poles had very recently concluded
peace with the Turks. But this made no difficulty. Sobieski
undertook by treaty to send an army of fifty thousand
men in support of the Emperor. There was a clause in
the treaty of a significant character. It was not to be
annulled by any future dispensation of the Pope. The
Polish army, however, was at some distance and could
not reach Vienna in less than eight weeks. There can be
little doubt that if Kara Mustapha had pressed the siege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
with vigour Vienna must have fallen before the arrival
of the Polish army.</p>

<p>This second great siege of Vienna began on July 15,
1683. The Emperor and his family fled to Bavaria. The
fortifications of Vienna had been much neglected and
offered no serious obstacle. But the city was heroically
and obstinately defended by its commander, Count von
Stahremberg, who emulated Count Salms of the first siege.
Twenty thousand of its citizens enrolled in its defence.
The Turkish batteries shattered the walls. There were
frequent sorties without avail. It was said that the Ottoman
army, with its enormous superiority in numbers, might
easily have carried the city by storm, but that Kara
Mustapha hoped to gain it by capitulation, in which case
the wealth of the city would be at his own disposal as
representative of the Sultan, whereas, if it were taken by
assault, the great booty would fall mainly to the soldiers.
He delayed, therefore, the final attack. Meanwhile Sobieski
had time to bring up his army from Poland and to join
Prince Charles of Lorraine, who was in command of the
Imperial troops, making a total force of eighty thousand.
They crossed the Danube at Tulm by a bridge of boats,
and then made a detour through a most difficult country
behind the Kalemberg, so as to attack the Turkish army
before the city from the rear. Kara Mustapha was guilty
of incredible neglect in not offering resistance to the crossing
of the Danube by the Christian force, or to their
passage through the difficult country behind the Kalemberg.
On September 6th rockets from the Kalemberg
announced to the garrison of the city that the relieving
army had occupied these heights behind the Turkish camp.</p>

<p>When Sobieski saw the great array of the Turkish camp
exposed to attack, he felt very confident of success. He
contemptuously said of the Grand Vizier: “This man
is badly encamped. He knows nothing of war. We shall
certainly beat him.” In an address to his troops he
said:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Warriors and friends, yonder on the plains are our enemies, in numbers
greater indeed than at Choczim, where we trod them underfoot. We have
to fight them on a foreign soil, but we fight for our own country, and
under the walls of Vienna we are defending those of Warsaw and Cracow.
We have to save to-day not a single city but the whole of Christendom,
of which the city of Vienna is the bulwark. The war is a holy one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>There is a blessing on our arms and a crown of glory for him who falls....
The infidels see you now above their heads, and with hopes blasted
and courage depressed are escaping among the valleys destined to be
their graves. I have but one command to give—Follow me! The time
is come for the young to win their spurs.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Kara Mustapha, when he saw the Christian army on
the heights above him, made immediate preparations for
battle. He gave orders for the massacre of thirty thousand
Christian captives, mostly women and children, taken
prisoners on the route to Vienna and destined to be sold
as slaves. Leaving the best of his men, the Janissaries,
in the trenches before the city, he concentrated the main
part of his army to meet the attack of the Poles from
the rear. Sobieski ranged his army in a great semicircle
and made a general advance against the Turks. The
Tartar irregulars fled and carried confusion to the rest of
the army. Sobieski then led his best troops direct against
the centre of the Turks. The mass of the Ottoman army
was broken and routed. Terrible slaughter followed, and
the whole of the Turkish camp, with immense booty, fell
into the hands of the Christians. The Janissaries in the
trenches before the city were then attacked on two sides,
by the victorious Poles from the rear and by the Viennese
garrison on the front. They were cut to pieces and
annihilated. The victory of Sobieski was complete and
final. Three hundred guns, nine thousand ammunition
wagons, and twenty-five thousand tents were captured.</p>

<p>The Turkish army was driven from the field and, panic-stricken,
took to flight. Untold thousands of them were
killed, together with great numbers of pashas and generals.
Kara Mustapha escaped with the mob of fugitives, carrying
with him the sacred banner of the Prophet. The
débris of the army found its way to Raab, and thence to
Buda, where the Grand Vizier ordered the execution of
some of the best officers of the army, whom he falsely
accused of being responsible for the disaster. He himself
then made his way to Belgrade, where, in his turn, he
was put to death, with much more justification, by order of
the Sultan. His immense and ill-gotten wealth was confiscated
by the State. He had lived in unprecedented
splendour. In his harem were fifteen hundred concubines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>attended each by a servant, and seven hundred eunuchs
to guard them. His own personal servants and horses
were counted by thousands.</p>

<p>The second siege of Vienna, thus brought to so glorious
an end by its brave garrison and by Sobieski, differed
essentially from that undertaken by Sultan Solyman in
1529. Solyman was compelled to raise the siege and
to retreat by the failure of food and munitions. He met
with no reverse in the field, and he was able to withdraw
his army intact. Mustapha fought a pitched battle against
a very inferior army coming in relief of the city, and was
defeated, and his army was routed and broken up. There
never was a greater disaster to an army or to a general.
It brought most serious results to the Ottoman Empire.
It broke once for all the prestige of the Turks as a
conquering nation. It removed the fear of an Ottoman
invasion which for two centuries had been a nightmare to
the Central States of Europe.</p>

<p>The attack on Vienna was practically the last effort
of the Ottomans to extend their Empire into an enemy’s
country. Henceforth they were almost always on the defensive.
It will be seen that the defeat of the huge army
by Sobieski resulted in the loss to the Turks of the greater
part of their conquests in Hungary, and that, in a few years,
it led to their being driven across the Danube.</p>

<p>Sobieski and Lorraine, after their great victory in front
of Vienna, followed it up with vigour. At Paskenay
they fell into an ambuscade prepared for them by the
retreating Turks and lost two thousand men, but two days
later they attacked the enemy and defeated them with
great slaughter. The bridge of boats across the Danube
by which the Turks retreated was broken by the rush
of fugitives and seven thousand were killed or drowned.
The Christian army then pressed on to Gran and invested
and captured that important fortress. It had been in possession
of the Turks for many years. Henceforth it was a
rampart of Austria and Hungary against them. This concluded
the year’s campaign. The Austrians and Poles
went into winter quarters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the effect of the great victory at Vienna was
to stimulate other Powers to join the combination against
the Turks. The Pope preached another crusade against
them—the fourteenth. The Republic of Venice fitted out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
a fleet, which was joined by galleys of the Pope,
the Knights of Malta, and the Grand Duke of Tuscany.
In the following year this fleet attacked and captured the
island of Santa Maura and the city of Prevesa, at the
entrance to the Gulf of Arta. A Venetian army also
invaded Bosnia and Albania.</p>

<p>In this year also (1684) the Austrians, under Lorraine,
issuing from Gran, crossed the Danube and attacked and
defeated the Turks at Warzen, and again in another battle
before Buda, and then besieged that fortress. But after
some weeks they were compelled by the rainy season and
disease in the army to raise the siege and retreat. Meanwhile
another Austrian army advanced into Croatia and
fought and defeated the Turks. As a result of this the
province of Croatia, which had been for one hundred and
fifty-one years under Turkish rule, was freed from it, and
was thenceforward an Austro-Hungarian possession.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1685, the Austrians made further
progress. The important stronghold of Neuhausel, which
twenty-two years previously had been captured by the Turks,
was now recaptured after a desperate resistance. Of its
garrison of three thousand men only two hundred survived.
The women and children of the Turks were sold to landowners
in the Austrian Empire. The capture of this city
was the cause of great rejoicing throughout Europe. In
1686 the siege of Buda was renewed. The Imperial army
consisted of ninety thousand men—Germans, Hungarians,
and Croats. It was under the command of the Prince
of Lorraine. The siege was commenced on June 18th.
Three attempts to relieve it under Grand Vizier Solyman
failed. After six weeks of siege the Austrians assaulted
and captured the city. Its brave defender, Abdi Pasha,
and its garrison perished, and the city was given up to
ruthless sack. The city had been in possession of the
Turks for a hundred and forty-five years, and during this
time had resisted successfully six sieges. It now passed
finally into the hands of the Hungarians.</p>

<p>The campaign of the following year, 1687, was opened
on the Drave. The Grand Vizier led an army of fifty
thousand men and sixty-six guns. It met the Austrians
at Mohacz on the very field where, a hundred and
sixty years previously, the Hungarians had been defeated
in the battle which gave one-half of their country to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Turks. The Ottomans were now in their turn defeated
and routed. Twenty thousand of them were killed, while
the loss of the successful army was only a thousand.
Slavonia was in the same year cleared of all Turkish
forces, and was permanently restored to Austria, while in
Transylvania the Voivode Apafy, who owed his position
to the Turks, now turned against them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Venetians had been equally successful
during the past three years. Their army, under Morosini,
invaded the Morea in 1686, captured all its strongholds,
and drove the Turks from the country. They also successfully
invaded Dalmatia. In 1687 they attacked and
captured the Piræus and Athens. It was on this occasion
that the Parthenon, which, in spite of many centuries of
war and dangers of all kinds, still existed in all its
original grandeur and beauty, was irreparably ruined. The
Turks had made use of it as a powder magazine, thinking
probably that it was safe from attack. A bomb from
the Venetian batteries exploded there, whether purposely
or not, and converted the temple into a ruin as we now
see it. The whole of Greece was now practically in the
hands of the Venetians. The Greek population had given
no aid to the Turks in resisting the new invaders. They
had soon to learn that there was little to choose between
their old and their new masters. If anything, the Venetians
proved to be the more tyrannical and rapacious.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the campaign of 1687 in Hungary
the Turkish army, as a result of its long series of defeats,
was seething with discontent, and was almost in a state
of mutiny. Its leading officers met and petitioned the
Sultan, demanding the dismissal and execution of its
general, the Grand Vizier Solyman. They elected Siawousch
Pasha as their general. The army then retreated across
the Danube to Philippopolis, and thence to Adrianople, from
whence it sent a deputation to the Sultan to enforce its
views. The Sultan summoned a great Council of State,
at which it was decided to accede to the demands of the
army. Siawousch Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier in
place of Solyman, who was soon after put to death by
order of the Sultan. It was hoped by this concession
to appease the army, and to prevent its march to
Constantinople. The army, however, persisted in its
threatening attitude and renewed its march to the capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
It now increased its demands. It insisted on the deposition
of the Sultan. There was general concurrence in this
among officials at Constantinople. Mustapha Kiuprili, the
brother of the late Ahmed Kiuprili, who was Kaimachan,
and performed the duties of Grand Vizier in his absence
from the capital, called an assembly of ulemas at St.
Sophia. He addressed them in these words:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Since the Padishah thinks only of diverting himself in the chase, and
at the time when the Empire is assaulted from all quarters we have seen
him dismiss all men capable of repairing our misfortunes, can you doubt
any longer that the dethronement of a Padishah who thus conducts the
affairs of the State is legally permitted?</p></blockquote>

<p>The ulemas unanimously concurred. They decided on
the dethronement of Sultan Mahomet and his replacement
on the throne, not by his son, but by his legal heir, his
next brother, Solyman. They then betook themselves to
the abode in the Seraglio where that prince was secluded,
called him forth, and announced to him their decision,
citing in favour of it a verse from the Koran: “We
have named you to be Khaliff of the country.”</p>

<p>There was no opposition to this. Solyman, who had
spent his life in seclusion, in constant fear of being
murdered by his brother, and who was only saved by
the brave efforts of the Sultana Validé, his mother, came
out of what was virtually a prison to be invested with the
insignia of Sultan. Mahomet, who had reigned as Sultan
for thirty-nine years, which he had devoted wholly to
the chase, to the neglect of every duty of his great office,
retired to the secluded building which his brother had
occupied so long. He died there a few years later,
regretted by no one.</p>

<p>Von Hammer gives a detailed account of one of Sultan
Mahomet’s organized expeditions in pursuit of game, which
may be worth quoting as an illustration of his pursuits
and character. The scene of it was between Adrianople
and Tirnova, and it occurred in 1683, the year in which
his army was engaged in the invasion of Austria and on the
siege of Vienna. Thirty thousand peasants were brought from
all parts for the purpose of beating the woods and putting
up the game. For their subsistence a levy was made on
the district of 150,000 marks. This battue cost the lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of a great number of beaters, who succumbed to the fatigue
of the operations. Many rayas were brought from as
far as Belgrade for the occasion. The Sultan, on seeing
the bodies of those who had perished, said to his followers:
“These men would doubtless have rebelled against me.
They have received their punishment in anticipation of
this.”</p>

<p>Mahomet, it would seem, owed his deposition not so
much to his own callous neglect of his duties as Sultan
as to the arrogant incapacity of Kara Mustapha in his
campaign against Vienna and the imbecility of the two
succeeding Grand Viziers, Ibrahim and Solyman.</p>

<p>Solyman, who thus mounted the throne in 1687, at the
age of forty-one, showed greater capacity than was to be
expected after his long seclusion in ‘the Cage,’ but
he was quite unequal to the task of controlling the
mutinous Janissaries. They filled Constantinople with
riot and slaughter. They pillaged the palaces of the viziers
and others. They attacked the harem of the Grand Vizier
Siawousch, whom they had so recently elevated to the
post. He was killed in bravely defending his harem. His
favourite wife and sister were dragged naked through the
streets after being cruelly mutilated. The disorder of the
capital became so unendurable that the population rose
in arms and assisted the authorities in resisting the
Janissaries. Their Agha and principal officers were put
to death, and order was at last restored.</p>

<p>In the spring of the next year, 1688, a well equipped
army was sent to the Hungarian frontier, in the hope of
retrieving the defeats of the past five years. The Austrians,
however, had made good use of the interval. They had
now three armies in the field, under the command of
Prince Charles of Lorraine, Prince Louis of Baden, and
Prince Eugène of Savoy—all three generals of exceptional
ability. They invested the fortress of Erlau and captured
it. The road to Belgrade now lay open to them. This
supremely important city, the bulwark to the Balkans and
the gateway to Hungary, was treacherously surrendered
by its garrison in August 1688 after a bombardment of
only twenty-one days. Prince Louis of Baden about the
same time invaded Bosnia and occupied a great part of
it. Dalmatia revolted and threw over Turkish rule. Nisch
was later occupied by the Austrians, and Widdin, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Danube, fell into their hands. By 1689 the only fortresses
in Hungary remaining to the Turks were Temesvar and
Warardin.</p>

<p>Farther eastward the Turks had been more fortunate.
An army of Tartars from the Crimea overran Poland in
1688 and defeated a Polish army on the Sereth. In
the following year, when Russia joined in the combination
against the Ottomans and sent an army into the Crimea,
it met with a severe defeat. These were the only rays of
light to the Turks. Elsewhere they met with a succession of
disasters. The Balkan provinces, for the first time since the
days of Hunyadi, were threatened by the Austrians. Parts
of Bosnia and Serbia were in their hands. The whole of
Greece and Albania had been conquered by the Venetians,
under Morosini, and the Turkish fleets had been swept
off the Mediterranean by the combined fleets of Venice,
the Pope, the Knights of Malta, and the Duke of Tuscany.
On the Ottoman side no single general of any capacity
had appeared.</p>

<p>It was under these conditions that a general council of
the Empire was summoned at Adrianople at the end of
1689. After a long discussion, it advised the Sultan to
appoint as Grand Vizier Zadé Kiuprili, who had been
passed over by Sultan Mahomet IV in favour of the corrupt
and incompetent Kara Mustapha after the death of Ahmed
Kiuprili. After thirteen years of misgovernment and
calamity this third member of the Kiuprili family was
called to power. He showed at once great vigour and
capacity. Addressing the chief dignitaries of the Empire,
he described the perilous condition of affairs: “If we
go on as we have been in the past, another campaign will
see the enemy encamped before Constantinople.” He took
immediate steps to restore the financial position.</p>

<p>Zadé Kiuprili repleted the treasury by heavy contributions
on the officials, who had enriched themselves at the
expense of the public. He filled the ranks of the army
by calling out veterans. He revived the Ottoman navy.
He fitted out a flotilla of vessels for service on the Danube.
He replaced a number of incompetent and corrupt governors
by honest men on whom he could rely. He endeavoured
to win the support of the Christian rayas throughout the
Empire. He issued imperative orders to all governors
and pashas that no one should be allowed to oppress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
rayas. No taxes were to be levied on them except the
capitation tax. He allowed the Christians everywhere to
build churches, though he himself was a most strict Mussulman.
He freed trade from many unwise and unnecessary
restrictions. He was personally austere and simple in his
habits, very reserved in his utterances. It was said of him
that he never committed a crime and never used a superfluous
word. He was commonly called ‘Kiuprili the
Virtuous.’ Unfortunately for his country, he held the post
of Grand Vizier for less than two years, for it will be
seen that he was killed in battle in 1691.</p>

<p>At the time when he assumed the Grand Vizierate the
Austrians had crossed the Danube and had advanced far
into Macedonia. Kiuprili sent an army against them and
defeated them in two engagements. As a result, nearly
all the important posts south of the Danube were recovered
and the pressure on the Empire in this quarter was removed.
Zadé Kiuprili now took command of the army in person,
and in August, 1690, advanced through Bulgaria, drove
the Austrians from their position between Sofia and
Nisch, and besieged and captured the latter place. He then
attacked and captured in succession Semendria, Widdin,
and Belgrade. Another Ottoman army under Tekeli Pasha
invaded Transylvania and drove the Austrians from it.
Kiuprili returned to Constantinople covered with glory.</p>

<p>About this time Sultan Solyman died and was succeeded
by his brother, Achmet II, who, like himself, had been
brought up in the seclusion of the Seraglio, and was quite
incompetent to rule the Empire or to lead its armies.
Fortunately he left matters in the hands of his Grand Vizier.
Kiuprili again led the army in the field and, advancing from
Belgrade in May, 1696, marched northwards on the right
bank of the Danube to meet the Austrians under Prince Louis
of Baden, who were advancing from Peterwardein. The
two armies met at Salankemen. Their flotillas engaged
on the Danube and the Turks were there the victors. But
on land the battle ended in great disaster to them. Against
the advice of the most experienced of his generals, Zadé
Kiuprili insisted on fighting, without waiting for reinforcements
that were on their way. A most desperate
battle took place in which the Turks were completely
defeated. The Grand Vizier, in the hope of restoring the
fortunes of the day, rushed into the mêlée, sword in hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and was killed while hewing his way through the Austrian
ranks. The Turkish troops were dispirited by the death
of their general and gave way. Panic and rout followed.
The Turkish camp and a hundred and twenty guns fell
into the hands of the Austrians. About the same time
Tekeli Pasha was also defeated by the Austrians and was
driven out of Transylvania. The Ottoman Empire was
again at a very low ebb after these disasters. Sultan
Achmet died heartbroken by the burden of shame and grief,
and was succeeded by his nephew, Mustapha II, the son of
Mahomet IV.</p>

<p>The new Sultan was not wanting in the will to relieve the
plight of his country, but it will be seen that he had not
the capacity or the persistency required in such an emergency.
He fully recognized that the main causes of disaster
were the dissolute habits and incapacity of his predecessors.
Immediately after his accession to the throne he issued a
Hatti-Scheriff in which he announced his intention of restoring
ancient usages and leading his armies in person. In
the course of this notable document he said:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Under monarchs who are the slaves of pleasure or who resign themselves
to indolent slumber, never do the servants of God enjoy peace
or repose. Henceforth voluptuousness, idle pastime, and sloth are
banished from this Court. While the Padishahs who have ruled since
the death of our sublime father Mahomet have heeded naught but their
fondness for pleasure and for ease, the unbelievers, the unclean beings,
have invaded with their armies the four frontiers of Islam. They have
subdued our provinces. They have pillaged the goods of the people of
Mahomet. They have dragged away into slavery the faithful with their
wives and little ones. This is known to all, as it is known to me. I therefore
have resolved, with the help of the Lord, to take a signal revenge upon
the unbelievers, that brood of hell; and I will myself begin the holy war
against them.... Do thou, my Grand Vizier, and ye others, my viziers,
my ulemas, my lieutenants and agas of my armies, do ye all of you assemble
round my person and meditate well on this my imperial Hatti-Scheriff.
Take counsel and inform me if I ought to open hostilities in person against
the Emperor or remain at Adrianople. Of these two measures choose
that which will be most profitable to the Faith to the Empire and to the
servants of God.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In response to this, the Divan met and discussed for
three days whether the new Sultan should command in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>person the army about to be sent against the Austrians.
They came to an adverse decision. They thought that it
would not only expose the sacred person of the Sultan to too
much risk, but would also involve excessive expense. They
probably thought also, but scarcely dared to express it,
that the Sultan, being quite inexperienced in military matters,
would be an encumbrance to the army. They advised the
Sultan that he ought not to commit his imperial person
to the chances of a campaign, but would do better to leave
the conduct of the war to the Grand Vizier. The Sultan
replied in the laconic words, “I persist in marching.” In
accordance with this decision, Mustapha in person, in spite
of his inexperience, led a well appointed army in the summer
of 1696 from Belgrade to Temesvar, capturing on the
way various minor fortified places. His first encounter
with the enemy near Temesvar was successful. The
Austrians were defeated with heavy loss and Temesvar was
relieved. Mustapha, however, did not pursue his success
further. He returned to Constantinople and there received
an ovation.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1697, Mustapha again marched
with his army from Belgrade into Hungary, without any
definite plans as to what he proposed to do. After many
councils of war and much irresolution, it was decided to
advance northwards to the River Theiss. The Austrian
army was now under command of Prince Eugène of Savoy,
who, we have seen, made his début at the siege of Vienna.
He was the ablest general of his time. The two armies
met at Zenta on the River Theiss, about sixty miles above
its junction with the Danube. The Turks had erected a
bridge over the river at this point. The Sultan and his
cavalry, and a great part of the artillery, had already
crossed the bridge. The infantry were still on the other
side. Prince Eugène with his army, coming suddenly upon
them, caught the Turkish army <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, divided
by the river. Advancing in a wide crescent, he attacked
the whole line of the Ottoman infantry who had not crossed
the river. There was great confusion in the ranks of the
Ottomans and discord among the leading officers and a
want of direction. A large body of Janissaries mutinied
on the field of battle and began to massacre their officers.
There ensued an overwhelming defeat of the Ottomans.
Twenty-six thousand Turks were slain on the battlefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
and ten thousand were drowned in their attempt to cross
the river.</p>

<p>The Grand Vizier, four other viziers, and a great number
of pashas and thirty aghas of Janissaries were killed; four
hundred and twenty standards were captured. The Sultan,
who had witnessed the battle from the other side of
the river in comparative safety, was able to escape with
some of his cavalry to Temesvar, and thence he returned
to Belgrade and Constantinople. This experience satisfied
his military ardour, and he never again appeared at the
head of his army. An immense booty fell into the hands
of the Austrians. All the Turkish guns were captured.
What remained of the army defeated at Zenta found its
way to Belgrade, and thence returned to Adrianople, while
Prince Eugène crossed the Danube into Bosnia and made
himself master of the greater part of that province.
This great victory of the Austrians, after fourteen years of
almost uninterrupted success, decided not only the campaign
but the war in their favour, and marked irrevocably the
decadence of the military power of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Six days after the battle the Sultan, in his peril, turned
once more to the Kiuprili family for help. In place of the
Grand Vizier, who had been killed at Zenta, he appointed
Hussein Kiuprili, a son of the elder brother of Mahomet
Kiuprili, and therefore a cousin of Ahmed. Until the
siege of Vienna he had given himself up to a life of pleasure,
but after that grave defeat of the Turks he filled with
great distinction many high posts in the government. He
was the fourth member of his family to hold the position of
Grand Vizier, and showed himself fully capable of bearing
the burden.</p>

<p>In the course of the following winter of 1697-8, many
efforts were made to bring about peace. Lord Paget, the
British Ambassador, offered the mediation of Great Britain
and Holland on the principle of <i>Uti possidetis</i>—that each
of the Powers concerned, Austria, Venice, and Poland, were
to retain what they had wrested from Turkey. Hussein
Kiuprili summoned a great Council of State to consider this.
He had personally fought at St. Gotthard and other battles,
and fully recognized the superiority of the Austrian army.
The Ottomans, since the siege of Vienna, had been defeated
by them in nine great battles, and had lost by siege
nine fortresses of the first rank. He felt that if the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
were prolonged there would be further reverses of the same
kind. At his instance, it was decided by the Council to
accept the mediation of Great Britain and Holland. The
other Powers, with the exception of Russia, were equally
willing. The Czar, Peter the Great, alone objected, and
warned the other Powers not to trust in Great Britain and
Holland, who, he said, were only thinking of their own
commercial interests. In spite of his efforts, it was decided
to hold a Peace Congress, at which all these Powers, including
Russia, eventually were represented. It was held at
Carlowitz, not far from Peterwardein, on the Danube, and
after seventy-two days’ discussion and negotiation it resulted
in peace on the basis suggested by Lord Paget. Austria,
it was finally agreed, was to retain possession of Transylvania
and Sclavonia and of all Hungary north of the
River Marosch and west of the River Theiss. This left to
the Ottomans only about one-third of their previous
dominions in Hungary. The Emperor also was relieved
from payment of tribute in respect of Hungary and Transylvania.
The Republic of Venice was to retain the Morea
and Albania, but was to give up its conquests north of the
Isthmus of Corinth—the only departure from the principle
of <i>Uti possidetis</i>. The Republic was also relieved from
payment of tribute to the Porte in respect of the island of
Zante. Poland was to retain Podolia. Russia was to have
Azoff and the districts north of the Sea of Azoff which were
actually in her occupation. The Czar Peter was dissatisfied
with this and refused to enter into a treaty upon these terms.
He would only agree to an armistice for two years on
this basis. The other three Powers concerned entered into
treaties of peace for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>This treaty of Carlowitz was of supreme importance in
the international relations of Europe. It recognized for
first time that the status of the Ottoman Empire was a matter
for the concern of all the Powers of Europe, and not
only of those at war with it. It established the principle
of equality of the Powers concerned, and rejected finally
the pretensions of the Ottoman Empire, founded on its long
career of conquest. Thenceforth there was no longer any
fear of the invasion of Central Europe by the Turks.
The settlement was not so ignominious to them as the later
treaties of Passarowitch, Kainardji, Adrianople, and Berlin,
but not the less it was a great triumph for the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Powers of Europe. In view of the long series of defeats
of the Ottoman army and the exhausted state of the Empire,
Hussein Kiuprili acted the part of a wise statesman in assenting
to the treaty. If his advice and that of other members
of his family had been followed, and the Christian subjects
of the Empire had been treated with justice, later humiliations
might have been avoided, and the Empire might
have survived intact to a much later date.</p>

<p>Hussein Kiuprili retained the post of Grand Vizier for
three years after the treaty of Carlowitz. During this
time he showed that he had most of the qualities of his more
distinguished relative, Ahmed Kiuprili. He was a man
of high culture and public spirit. He did his best by
wise and salutary reforms to stem the growing evils of
the State. He aimed at curbing the mutinous power of the
Janissaries. He endeavoured in many ways to improve
the deplorable condition of the rayas. His reforms met
with violent opposition from reactionaries. His health broke
down under the stress and he was compelled to resign his
post. He died within a few weeks, in 1702. His reforms
did not survive him. His successor, Daltaban Pasha, was
a man of a totally different type, a savage Serbian, who
could neither read nor write, and who had acquired a
reputation for gross cruelty which he fully justified in
his more exalted position.</p>

<p>Once again, in 1710, another member of the Kiuprili
family, Nououman Kiuprili, was appointed Grand Vizier,
but though he had many of the virtues of his race he did
not prove to be equal to the post. He insisted on attempting
to do too much. He interfered with every detail of
the State and accumulated the hostility of all his
subordinates. The affairs of the government fell into
confusion and he was in consequence deposed after a very
few months. The names of five other members of the
same family appear in the history of the next few years
as generals and governors of provinces.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether in the annals of any country
a single family has produced so many distinguished men,
owing their position, not to personal favour, but to their
own merits and to the exigencies of the State. The case
is unique in the history of Turkey, where it would be
difficult to find another instance where two members of
any family rose to distinction.</p>

TO THE TREATY OF PASSAROWITCH<br />

<small>1702-18</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mustapha</span> did not long survive as Sultan the death of his
great Vizier, Hussein, the fourth of the Kiuprilis. He had
not fulfilled the early expectation of his reign, when, against
the advice of the Divan, he took command of his army
in the field. Disappointed and discouraged by his failure,
he fell back on a life of indolence and debauchery. After
the death of Hussein Kiuprili there was widespread discontent
throughout the Empire, and in most parts imminent
danger of rebellion. Mustapha had not the courage to
cope with it. He abdicated the throne and retired voluntarily
to the Cage. He was succeeded by his brother,
Achmet III, at the age of thirty, who reigned for twenty-seven
years till he was deposed at the instigation of the
Janissaries.</p>

<p>Achmet had not been subjected by his uncle to the
customary seclusion. He came to the throne, therefore,
with greater knowledge of the world. He was not a
warrior. He did not attempt to lead his armies in the
field. But he did not allow the affairs of State to fall into
the hands of women of his harem. Neither did he permit
ambitious Viziers to monopolize power. He changed them
so often that this was impossible. During the first fifteen
years of his reign there were twelve Grand Viziers. It
was imputed to him that these frequent changes were due
to his want of money and the extravagances of his harem.
It was the custom for Grand Viziers, on their appointment,
to make very large presents in money to the Sultan, and
Achmet looked on this as a source of income. But during
their short tenures of office he interfered very little with
them. He was, however, personally in favour of a policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
of peace, and supported his Viziers in its maintenance. The
first six years and the last twelve years of his reign were
periods of almost unbroken peace to the Empire. In the
other nine years there were many important events bearing
on the extension or reduction of his Empire. Territory
formerly in the possession of the Ottomans was reconquered,
and provinces long held by them were lost. The city of
Azoff and its adjoining territory—important for the protection
of the Crimea—were recovered from Russia. The
Morea and Albania were reconquered from the Republic
of Venice. By agreement with Russia a partition was made
of important provinces belonging to Persia, some of which
had formerly been in the possession of the Porte. On
the other hand, as the result of war with Austria, the remaining
part of Hungary, not included in the cession made
by the treaty of Carlowitz, and considerable parts of
Serbia and Wallachia were lost to the Empire. The gains
in territory exceeded in area the losses. But there can be
little doubt that the loss of prestige by the Ottomans from
the defeats of their armies by the Austrians under Prince
Eugène was not compensated for by victories over the
Venetians and Persians, or over the very inferior army of
Peter the Great.</p>

<p>The first of the wars thus referred to was that with
Russia, then under the rule of Peter the Great. He was
ambitious of extending his Empire by the acquisition of
the Crimea, and of thus getting access to the Black Sea.
It was only after the defeat of Charles XII, the King of
Sweden, at the battle of Pultowa in 1709, and the consequent
conquest of Livonia, that his hands were free for
aggression elsewhere. Russia was already in possession of
the important fortress of Azoff, on the north-east shore of
the sea of that name. The Czar had also fortified Taganrog
and other places threatening the Crimea. The Porte was
alarmed by these manifest preparations for war. The
relations of the two Governments were also embittered by
the fact that the Swedish King, Charles XII, after his
defeat at Pultowa, sought refuge in Turkey, and that the
Sultan accorded a generous hospitality to him, and with great
magnanimity refused the demand of Peter for his extradition.
It followed that, in 1711, the Porte anticipated the
undoubted hostile intention of the Czar, and declared war
against Russia. An army was sent by the Sultan across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the River Pruth into Moldavia, under command of Grand
Vizier Baltadji. This pasha had risen to his post from
the humble position of woodcutter at the palace, through
the intrigues of his wife, who had been a slave in the
Sultan’s harem. The Czar, on his part, had collected his
forces in the south of Poland and marched into Moldavia.
The two armies met on the River Pruth. The Russian
army, already greatly reduced in number by want of food
and disease, numbered no more than twenty-four thousand
men. The Ottomans, who had been reinforced by a large
body of Tartars, under the Khan of the Crimea, were at
least five times more numerous. The Czar Peter, unaware
that the Ottomans had crossed the Danube, advanced
rashly on the right bank of the Pruth, and was posted
between that river and an extensive marsh not far
from Zurawna. The position was dominated by hills, which
the Grand Vizier occupied in force, and his numerous and
powerful guns swept the position of the Russians, cut off
their access to the river, and completely hemmed them in.
Their plight is best described in a letter which the Czar
wrote to the Russian Senate at Moscow from his camp at
this point:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I announce to you that, deceived by false intelligence and without
blame on my part, I find myself shut up in my camp by a Turkish army.
Our supplies are cut off, and we momentarily expect to be destroyed or
taken prisoners, unless Heaven should come to our aid in some unexpected
manner. Should it happen to me to be taken prisoner by the Turks
you will no longer consider me as your Czar and Sovereign, nor will you
pay any attention to any orders that may be brought to you from me, not
even if you recognize my handwriting; but you will wait for my coming
in person. If I am to perish here, and you receive well confirmed
intelligence of my death, you will then proceed to choose as my successor
him who is most worthy among you.</p></blockquote>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Russian army was completely
at the mercy of the Ottomans, and might have been
entirely destroyed or captured. It was saved from either
fate by the Czar’s wife, Catherine. She was the daughter
of a peasant, married in the first instance to a dragoon in
the Russian army, and later the mistress of Prince
Menschikoff. Peter, smitten by her beauty and wit had
recently married her, and she was with him on this campaign.
This lady, with great presence of mind, collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
what money she could, to the value of a few thousand
roubles, and sent it and her jewellery with a letter to the
Kiaya of the Grand Vizier, suggesting a suspension of hostilities
with a view to terms of agreement. In this way
relations were established between the two generals, and
a treaty of peace was agreed to. Its terms were very
humiliating to Russia. Azoff and its surrounding district
were to be surrendered to the Porte. Taganrog and some
other fortresses were to be dismantled. The Russian army
was to withdraw from Poland. The King of Sweden was
to be allowed safe conduct through Russia to his own
country. There was to be no Russian ambassador in the
future at Constantinople. In return for these great concessions
the Russian army was to be permitted to retreat
without molestation.</p>

<p>The preamble to the treaty contained the following
remarkable admission of the predicament in which the Czar
and his army were placed:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By the grace of God, the victorious Mussulman army has closely
hemmed the Czar of Muscovy with all his troops in the neighbourhood
of the River Pruth, and the Czar has asked for peace, and it is at his
request that the following articles are drawn up and granted.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was also declared in the treaty by the Grand Vizier
“that he made the peace by virtue of full powers vested
in him, and that he entreated the Sultan to ratify the
treaty, and overlook the previous evil conduct of the
Czar.”</p>

<p>The signing of the treaty of the Pruth was vehemently
opposed by the King of Sweden, who was in the Ottoman
camp, and by the Khan of the Crimea. They doubtless had
good reasons of their own for wishing the war with Russia
to be prolonged. It was due to their intrigues at Constantinople
that violent opposition was roused to the
ratification of the treaty. Baltadji found on his return that,
instead of being received with acclamation for having recovered
Azoff and other territory, of which the Porte had
been deprived a few years previously, he was dismissed
from his office with disgrace. The Kiaya Osman and the
Reis Effendi Omer, who were believed to be largely
responsible for the treaty, were put to death by order of
the Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>The Porte refused to ratify the treaty, and preparations
were made for a renewal of the war with Russia. But
wiser counsels ultimately prevailed, largely through the
advice of the British Ambassador, Sir R. Sutton; and two
years later, after long negotiation, another treaty was
concluded with the Czar, which embodied all the terms
of that effected by Baltadji which had been so much
objected to.</p>

<p>Many historians have found fault with Baltadji for having
neglected the opportunity of destroying or capturing the
Russian army and the Czar Peter himself, and for having
allowed them to escape by concluding the treaty. It has
been suggested that he was bribed by the Empress
Catherine. It is, however, inconceivable that one in the
high position of Grand Vizier, where there were such
immense opportunities for enrichment, could have sold himself
and his country for so small a price. It is more
probable that the presents of the Empress were made to
the subordinate of the Grand Vizier for the purpose of
opening negotiations with him. It is also more reasonable
to conclude that Baltadji was convinced that no better
terms could be obtained by a prolongation of the war.
The destruction of the Russian army or its capture, together
with the Czar, would have roused the Russian people to
a great effort to avenge such a disaster. It is significant
that the Sultan, while putting to death the Kiaya and Reis
Effendi, spared the life of Baltadji, who was mainly responsible,
and simply dismissed him from the office of Grand
Vizier. This seems to indicate that the Sultan had given
authority in advance to Baltadji, as stated in the treaty, to
agree to terms such as were actually obtained. It seems to
be unlikely that Sultan Achmet desired to extend his Empire
beyond the territory of Azoff into the heart of Russia.
What better terms, then, could have been obtained by
prolonging the war?</p>

<p>It has also been contended by some historians that it
was unwise policy to impose such a humiliation on the
Czar as that embodied in the treaty; that it was certain
to lead to a renewal of the war for the purpose of avenging
it. But the Czar himself did not apparently take this
view of the case. After the escape of his army from
disaster he showed no inclination to renew the war. He
was willing, two years later, to re-enact the treaty, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
spite of its humiliating terms. He did not break peace
with the Turks in the remaining ten years of his reign.
He did not bear a grudge against them and after a few years
he entered into an arrangement with the Sultan for the
partition of a large part of Persia.</p>

<p>On a review of the whole transaction, we must conclude
that the Grand Vizier Baltadji was fully justified in effecting
the treaty of the Pruth, and that it was no small
achievement, by the skilful manœuvring of his army and
without the loss of a single life, to impose terms on
the Czar, under which the Ottoman Empire recovered
Azoff and its district, the key to the Crimea, and
obtained the other valuable concessions embodied in the
treaty.</p>

<p>In 1715 the Porte embarked on another war, this time
against the Republic of Venice, with the object of recovering
the Morea, which sixteen years previously had been
conquered by the Republic, when in alliance with Austria,
and the possession of which had been confirmed to the
Republic by the treaty of Carlowitz. Morosini, the Venetian
general by whom this conquest had been achieved, was now
dead. It was thought that Austria would not intervene. A
pretext for the war was found in the assistance which the
Republic rendered to the Montenegrins in an insurrection
against the Porte. The army, which had been equipped for
war with Russia, was now available for other purposes.
The Grand Vizier Damad, who was also otherwise known
as Coumourgi, son-in-law of the Sultan, took command of
an army of a hundred thousand men. A fleet of one
hundred sail co-operated by sea. The Sultan himself
accompanied the army as far as Larissa, in Thessaly, but
no farther. He left the direction of it wholly in the
hands of Damad, who showed great ability in the conduct
of the war. It commenced with the siege of Corinth,
which, after a brave defence of three weeks, capitulated
on July 7, 1715, on favourable terms. But a
powder magazine blew up during the evacuation of the
fortress, killing six or seven hundred of the Turkish soldiers.
This afforded an excuse for breaking the agreement,
and for a general massacre of Venetians and Greeks,
whether of the garrison or inhabitants—much to the
disapproval of Damad. This siege of Corinth formed
the subject of Lord Byron’s well-known poem, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
which Damad is referred to under the name of
Coumourgi:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Coumourgi—can his glory cease,</div>
<div class="line">That latest conqueror of Greece,</div>
<div class="line">Till Christian hands to Greece restore</div>
<div class="line">The freedom Venice gave of yore?</div>
<div class="line">A hundred years have rolled away</div>
<div class="line">Since he refixed the Moslem sway.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>With poetic licence Byron attributes to the Venetian
governor of Corinth the setting fire to the powder magazine
and the fearful destruction of life which it caused:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">When old Minotti’s hand</div>
<div class="line">Touched with the torch the train—</div>
<div class="line">’Tis fired.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There seems to have been no more justification in fact for
this than for the statement that the Venetians gave liberty
to the Greeks. Nothing is more certain than that the
Greeks hated the rule of Venice as more oppressive than
that of the Turks.</p>

<p>After the capture of Corinth the Ottoman army, in two
divisions, invaded the Morea, and had no difficulty in
capturing all the Venetian fortresses there, such as Modon,
Coron, and Navarino. The Greek inhabitants gave no
assistance to their Venetian masters. They welcomed the
Turks as their deliverers from an odious tyranny.</p>

<p>The reconquest of the Morea occupied Damad and his
army for only a hundred and one days. There was no
pitched battle with the Venetians. The campaign consisted
of a succession of sieges of fortresses. It was
the intention of the Ottomans to complete the expulsion
of the Venetians by the capture of Corfu and the other
Ionian islands, but at this stage the Emperor of Austria,
Charles VI, intervened, and entered into a defensive alliance
with the Republic of Venice. It was too late, however, to
save the Morea. There was much difference of opinion
at the Court of the Sultan whether the action of Austria
should be treated as a <i>casus belli</i>. The Grand Vizier Damad
vehemently contended that it was a breach of the treaty
of Carlowitz. He was a man of great force of character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
and very eloquent. But there was strong opposition to
him. The debates in the Divan, in presence of the Sultan,
have been recorded and are interesting reading. The
Mufti, when consulted on the subject, gave his judgment
in favour of Damad. This decided the Council. War
was declared against Austria, and in 1716 an army of
a hundred and fifty thousand was sent, under command
of Damad, to attack the Austrians. It reached Belgrade
in September. A council of war was then held to decide
whether to advance towards Temesvar or Peterwardein.
There was again difference on the subject. Damad
ultimately gave his decision in favour of the latter project.</p>

<p>The Turks crossed the River Saave by a bridge of boats,
and then marched along the bank of the Danube towards
Peterwardein. Their van came in contact with that of the
Austrians at the village of Carlowitz, where, sixteen years
before, the last treaty had been signed. From Carlowitz
to Peterwardein the distance is only two leagues. The
Austrian army, greatly inferior in numbers to that of the
Turks, was posted in front of the great fortress, behind
entrenchments which had been made by Siawousch Pasha
in the last war. It was again commanded by Prince
Eugène of Savoy, who, in the interval, had gathered fresh
laurels in many hard-fought battles for Austria, and who
was second to no living general, save only the Duke of
Marlborough, by whose side he fought so many battles.
The two armies came to issue on August 10, 1716. At
first the battle went in favour of the Ottomans. Their
redoubtable Janissaries broke the line of the Austrian
infantry opposed to them. Prince Eugène then brought
up his reserve of cavalry. They charged the Janissaries
with irresistible force, and retrieved the fortunes of the
day. Damad Pasha, when he saw that the tide of battle
was turning against him, put himself at the head of a band
of officers and galloped into the thick of the battle, in
the hope of infusing fresh courage in his army. He was
struck down and was carried from the field to Carlowitz,
where he died.</p>

<p>As so often happened to the Turks, the loss of their
leader caused a panic in their ranks and completed their
discomfiture. Their left wing retreated in the direction of
Belgrade, and was followed by the débris of the rest of the
army. One hundred and forty of their guns were captured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Their camp and an immense booty fell into the hands of
the enemy. The battle, however, was not very costly in
men to either side. The Austrians lost three thousand
men and the Turks about double the number. Eugène
followed up his success by the siege of Temesvar, the
last great stronghold of the Ottomans in Hungary. He
appeared before it twenty days after the battle of Peterwardein.
Its garrison of eighteen thousand men capitulated,
after a siege of five weeks, on November 25th. This
completed the campaign of 1716. The Turks had not
been more successful in other directions. They were compelled
to raise the siege of Corfu. Their fleet often met
that of the Venetians and had rather the worst of it,
though there was no decisive battle.</p>

<p>In the year following, 1717, another large army was
sent from Constantinople to the Danube, under Grand
Vizier Khalil, who had succeeded Damad after the battle
of Peterwardein. It consisted of a hundred and fifty
thousand men, of whom eighty thousand were Janissaries
and Spahis. It was no more fortunate than that under
Damad in the previous year. Prince Eugène, still in command
of the Austrians, had opened the campaign by
marching to Belgrade with a force of not more than
seventy thousand men. He besieged the city and fortress,
which was garrisoned by thirty thousand Ottomans. When,
after three weeks of siege, the Ottoman army came in
sight, so vastly superior in numbers, the position of Eugène
was most critical. The garrison of Belgrade was in front
of him and Khalil’s army, double in number of his own,
threatened his rear.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that if the Ottoman general had
attacked the Austrians without delay he would have been
successful. He hesitated and delayed. He ended by an
effort to besiege the besiegers. He entrenched his army
in the rear of that of Eugène. The two armies then
fired their heavy guns on one another without much result.
The Turks were greatly superior in this respect. They
were provided with a hundred and forty guns and thirty-five
mortars. Failure of food would have compelled the
Turks to an issue. But Prince Eugène anticipated this
by making an attack himself on the Ottoman lines. Never
was a bolder course attempted by a general, and never
was there a more brilliant success. With greatly inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
force, the Austrians stormed the Turkish lines on
August 16, 1717, little more than a year from the
day on which the battle of Peterwardein had been
fought. The Ottomans gave way along their whole line.
Twenty thousand of them were killed or wounded, while
the loss of the Austrians in killed was no more than two
thousand. Prince Eugène himself was wounded for the
thirteenth time in his great career. The Turks retreated
in disorder. They lost a hundred and thirty-one guns
and thirty-five mortars and a vast supply of munitions.
On the following day Belgrade and its garrison of thirty
thousand men surrendered.</p>

<p>After the battle before Belgrade and the capture of
that fortress, the Austrians advanced and occupied a great
part of Serbia and Western Wallachia. They appealed
to the Serbian people to rise against their Ottoman masters,
but not more than twelve hundred answered the appeal
and joined the Austrian army. There was no desire on
the part of the Serbians to exchange Turkish for Austrian
rule. The occupation by the Austrians of territory south
of the Danube proved to be temporary. Twenty-two years
later the Ottomans recaptured Belgrade and drove the
Austrians from Serbia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Grand Vizier Khalil was dismissed from
office by the Sultan for the incapacity which he had shown
in the campaign and in the battle of Belgrade. After
a time he was succeeded by Damad Ibrahim, a son-in-law
and lifelong favourite of the Sultan, who held the post
for twelve years, till the deposition of Achmet in 1730.
He proved himself in every way worthy of his high office.
There was a desire in many quarters to embark on another
campaign for the recovery of Hungary. But in the winter
of 1717-18 the British Ambassador again proposed mediation,
on behalf of England and Holland, on the principle
of <i>Uti possidetis</i>. This was accepted by both Austria and
the Porte. The Emperor was willing to content himself
with what he had already achieved, the more so as there
was danger of war in other directions. There was more
difficulty on the part of the Ottomans. But the Sultan
and the Grand Vizier ultimately gave their decision in
favour of peace.</p>

<p>The precedent of the Congress of Carlowitz was closely
followed. A congress was held at Passarowitch, a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
town in Serbia. England and Holland again acted as
mediators. After long discussion, agreement was arrived
at, and was embodied in a treaty known as that of
Passarowitch, on July 21, 1718. By its terms the whole
of what remained of Hungary to the Ottoman Empire
after the treaty of Carlowitz, a large part of Wallachia,
bounded by the River Aluta, and the greater part of Serbia,
and a portion of Bosnia bounded by the Rivers Morava,
Drina, and Unna, together with the fortresses of Belgrade
and Semendria, were ceded to the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Republic of Venice, on whose behalf Austria had
embarked on the war, fared badly by the treaty. It had
to give up to Ottoman rule the whole of the Morea which
had been reconquered by Damad, but received some concessions
in Dalmatia. It was, however, arranged by the
Congress that the Porte should have an access to the
Adriatic, so as to protect the Republic of Ragusa from
Venice. There remained to Venice of its possessions in
this quarter only the island of Corfu, the other Ionian
islands, and a few ports on the Albanian and Dalmatian
coasts. The Porte engaged by the treaty to put a stop
to the piracy of Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and Ragusa, and
to prohibit the residence of the Hungarian rebels in the
vicinity of the new Austrian frontier.</p>

<p>The treaty of Passarowitch, following on the great defeats
of the Ottomans at the battles of Peterwardein and Belgrade,
was almost as important as that of Carlowitz. It
determined finally the release of the whole of Hungary
from the Ottomans. Their rule there had never been more
than a military occupation. There was no real incorporation
of the country in the Ottoman Empire. There had
been no attempt to settle Turks there, or to impose the
Moslem religion on its population. After the expulsion
of the garrisons from the various fortresses, all vestiges
of the Ottomans disappeared, and no trace of them
remained as evidence that they had ever been masters
there.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> It was a great achievement of the Austrians, for
which Prince Eugène was mainly responsible. It should
be added, however, that there does not appear to have
been any popular rising of the people of Hungary, whether
Magyars or Sclavs, either in these last two years of war
or in the previous war of 1698-9, against their Ottoman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>rulers. It has been shown that the earlier war had its
commencement in an insurrection against the Austrians
in that part of Hungary subject to their rule. The Turks
hoped to take advantage of this. They appear to have
been in close relation with these insurgents throughout these
two wars. The Austrians defeated the Turks and drove
them out of the country, but their bigoted tyranny was
not more acceptable to the inhabitants than that of the
Turks. Many years were to elapse before the Magyars of
Hungary secured for themselves the benefits of self-government.</p>

<p>The war with Austria, which resulted in the treaty of
Passarowitch, did something more than free Hungary from
Ottoman rule. It completed the destruction of the prestige
of the Turkish armies which had so long weighed on the
mind of Europe. The great battles of Peterwardein and
Belgrade, in which the Turks were defeated by Austrian
armies of very inferior numbers, following as they did
a long succession of similar defeats from the battle of
St. Gotthard downwards, showed conclusively that the
Ottoman armies were no match for the well-disciplined
forces of Austria when led by competent generals. The
Ottomans seem to have been completely cowed by the
succession of defeats. Thenceforth they were always on
the defensive in Europe, and never willingly acted the
part of aggressors. It became the settled conviction of
Europe not only that there was no longer any reason to
fear invasion from the Turks, but that it was only a question
of time when they would be driven back into Asia.</p>

<h2><small>XV</small><br /><br />

TO THE TREATY OF BELGRADE<br />

<small>1718-39</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> remainder of Sultan Achmet’s reign, till his deposition
in 1730, was a period of uninterrupted peace, so far as
Europe was concerned. Damad Ibrahim retained his post as
Grand Vizier for twelve years, during which he had the
absolute confidence of the Sultan and practically ruled the
Empire. His policy was distinctly favourable to peace. The
only disturbance to it was on the frontier of Persia. That
kingdom was in a state of commotion. Its feeble and
incompetent ruler, Shah Hussein, was subverted by an
Afghan adventurer, Mahmoud. Hussein’s son, Tahmasp,
appealed to the Czar of Russia and to the Sultan of Turkey
for aid to recover his kingdom. Peter the Great offered
his support in return for the cession of provinces in the
Caspian and Black Sea, and sent an army to take possession
of them. This greatly alarmed the Porte, and it
threatened war with Russia. Eventually, however, war was
avoided. An agreement was arrived at, in 1723, between
the two Powers for the partition between them of the
greater part of North Persia. The Porte was to have
as its share the provinces of Georgia, Erivan, Tabriz, and
Baku. Russia was to have Schirvan and the other provinces
already promised to it by Tahmasp. Russia was practically
already in possession of its share. The Porte had
to send an army to conquer the provinces which were to
be its portion. It met with some opposition, but the cities
of Erivan and Tabriz were captured. This brought the
Porte into conflict with Tahmasp, but eventually an agreement
was arrived at. Tahmasp was thrown over, and
Mahmoud recognized the sovereignty of the Porte over
the provinces referred to. It is not worth while enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>ing
further into details of these transactions, for it will
be seen that in a few years Persia, under Nadir Khan,
acting on behalf of Tahmasp, recovered these provinces.</p>

<p>After a reign of twenty-seven years a mutiny broke out
against Achmet among the turbulent Janissaries, headed
by Patrona, an Albanian soldier in their ranks. It
speedily spread among the whole body of soldiers, and
was supported by the dregs of the population of the city
and by a band of criminals whom they had released from
prison. It was probably promoted by enemies of the Grand
Vizier. There was much want of vigour in dealing with
the outbreak at its early stage. Subsequent events under
Achmet’s successor showed that it was not really of a
formidable character and that it might easily have been
put down at its inception by strong measures against its
ringleaders. It was allowed, however, to gather head and
to spread. It was said that the mutiny was due to the
unpopularity of the Sultan, his profuse expenditure, and
the great pomp he maintained. This scarcely seems to
afford a sufficient explanation. It has also been suggested
that among other causes was the discontent of the soldiers
on account of the long peace and the lack of opportunity
for loot, and perhaps also the expectation of the customary
large presents on the accession of a new Sultan. When
the rebels got the upper hand they made no substantial
proposals for a new policy.</p>

<p>The Sultan, at an early stage, consulted his sister, the
Sultana Khadidjé, who advised him to keep his ministers
close at hand, so that he might save his own life at their
expense, if the rebels would be satisfied by a concession
of this kind. He appears to have followed this advice.
He lost his head in the crisis, and quailed before the
mutineers. He entered into parleys with them. They
demanded the surrender to them of three of the principal
ministers. Achmet asked whether they wished these
ministers to be handed to them alive or dead. They unanimously
agreed that they wished to have the dead bodies.
The Sultan thereupon had the base and incredible meanness
to order that his Grand Vizier—his lifelong friend, married
to his daughter—the Capitan Pasha, and the Kiaya were to
be strangled and their bodies given up to the mutineers.
This did not content the Janissaries. They demanded the
deposition of the Sultan. Achmet then offered to abdicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the throne on condition that his life and those of his
children should be spared. They agreed to this. Achmet
thereupon summoned before him his nephew, Mahmoud,
whom he acclaimed as Padishah in place of himself and
made obeisance. He then retired to the Cage from which
Mahmoud had emerged, and there spent the remainder of
his life in seclusion.</p>

<p>Mahmoud, the son of Mustapha II, succeeded at the
age of thirty-four. Achmet had not treated him with the
same generosity that he had himself experienced from
Mustapha II, but had insisted on his seclusion in the Cage.
After spending so many of his best years in this way,
Mahmoud was unfitted for active duties as head of the State.
He had a turn for literature, and was a generous patron of
public libraries and schools; but as regards the direction
of affairs of the Empire he was wholly incompetent.
He fell completely under the influence of the Kislaraga,
the chief eunuch of his harem, Bashir by name, who acted
as his secretary. Bashir had been an Abyssinian slave,
and was bought for the Sultan’s harem for 30 piastres.
Little is known of the personality of this man, save that,
from behind the curtain of the harem, he practically exercised
supreme power for nearly thirty years, and died at
a very advanced age, leaving a fortune of more than thirty
millions of piastres and immense quantities of valuables.
These included more than eight hundred watches, set with
precious stones, which, it must be presumed, were the gifts
of applicants for appointments. Bashir made and unmade
Grand Viziers at his will, and if any one of them complained
of Bashir’s interference with his duties, that was the more
reason for his instant dismissal. In Mahmoud’s reign of
twenty-four years there were sixteen Grand Viziers. In
any case, it must be admitted that the success of Mahmoud’s
reign, such as it was, and the continuity of policy, were
mainly due to this aged eunuch.</p>

<p>In the first few weeks of the new Sultan’s reign the
supreme power of the State was practically in the hands
of the rebel Janissaries, under the leadership of Patrona
and Massuli, who were soldiers in their ranks. These men
soon made themselves intolerable by their insolence and
bravado. Patrona installed his concubine in one of the
Sultan’s palaces, and when she gave birth to a child there,
insisted on the Sultana Validé treating her with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
courtesies due to royalty. He insisted also on the appointment
as Hospodar of Moldavia of his personal friend, a
Greek butcher named Yanaki, who had lent him money.
The bolder men about the Sultan determined to get rid
of these men. The Janissaries and other soldiers who had
joined in the deposition of Achmet were brought to a
better frame of mind by large distributions of money.
They promised to obey their officers, on condition that no
punishment should be awarded to them for their part in
the rebellion. Patrona and Massuli and twenty-one of
their leading adherents were then summoned to a meeting
of ministers at the palace, and were massacred there in
presence of the Sultan himself. Within three days seven
thousand of the rebellious Janissaries were put to death.</p>

<p>Pacification having thus been effected at the capital,
attention was turned to Persia, where, as has been pointed
out, a partition treaty with Russia had assigned a large part
of that kingdom to the Porte, but the possession of which
had not yet been obtained. In the meantime a brigand
chief, Nadir, later to become world-famous as the invader
of India, had taken service under Tahmasp, the son of
the dethroned Hussein. Nadir succeeded in driving the
Afghans out of Persia and reinstating Tahmasp as Shah.
He proceeded, however, to usurp the power of that feeble
monarch, and eventually got himself accepted as Shah in
place of Tahmasp. He declared war against the Turks in
1733-5 and, after defeating them in several engagements,
compelled them to sue for terms of peace. The Porte was
the more ready to accede to terms as war with Russia was
imminent. A treaty of peace was therefore agreed to with
Nadir in 1735, under which all the provinces which were
the subject of the partition treaty with Russia were restored
to Persia. Russia also, in prospect of war with Turkey,
came to terms with Nadir, and surrendered nearly all the
territory which had been acquired under the partition treaty
with Turkey.</p>

<p>Peter the Great had died in 1727, and in 1730 was
succeeded by the Empress Anne, a clever and ambitious
woman. She was incited to war with Turkey by Marshal
Munnich, the ablest general whom Russia so far had produced.
He promised to drive the Turks out of Europe. At
Constantinople the eunuch Bashir was in favour of a policy
of peace. He was over seventy years of age and wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to end his days in repose. He resisted as far as he could
every attempt to draw the Sultan into war. The French
Ambassador, under instructions from his Government, was
most anxious to embroil Turkey with Austria. The two
maritime Powers, however—Great Britain and Holland—pulled
in the opposite direction, and peace was maintained
as long as possible. But when, in 1735, the Russians,
though nominally at peace with Turkey, captured two
fortresses in the neighbourhood of Azoff and threatened
that most important outpost of the Empire, the Porte
declared war. A Russian army of fifty-four thousand men,
under command of Marshal Munnich, then invaded the
Crimea. They stormed and broke through the fortified
lines of Perekop at the isthmus of that name, joining the
Crimea to the mainland, hitherto thought to be impregnable.
They captured the city of Perekop, and then overran
the whole of the Crimea, devastating it and massacring
its inhabitants by thousands. The Russian army, however,
suffered greatly from exhaustion and disease in the campaign,
and it eventually withdrew from the Crimea before
the winter. Another Russian force, under General Leontiew,
captured Kilburn, and a third, under General Lascy, an
Irishman by birth, attacked and captured the city of Azoff.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russian diplomatists discovered that the
Emperor of Austria, Charles VI, was quite as anxious as
the Czarina Anne to possess himself of Turkish provinces,
and was ready to enter into a coalition for the purpose.
In the winter of 1736-7 a secret treaty for this purpose
was entered into between the two potentates. But as it
was not thought expedient by the Austrians to commence
their attack until all their preparations for it were completed,
a pretence was made of negotiations with the Porte,
who had made overtures of peace to the Russians. For
this purpose a Congress was held at Nimirof early in 1737.
Later it became known that the negotiations on the part
of the two allied Empires were illusory, and that there
never was any intention to come to terms. The Porte,
on its part, was extremely anxious for peace, and was
ready to make large concessions, but the terms suggested
on behalf of Russia were so extortionate that it was quite
impossible for the Sultan and his ministers to entertain
them. The Russians demanded the cession of the
Crimea, the independence of Wallachia and Moldavia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
under a native prince, subject to the supremacy of
Russia, the opening of the Black Sea and access to
it through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles to Russian
vessels of war, and the payment of fourteen millions
of roubles. Austria, on its part, demanded the cession
of the whole of Bosnia and Serbia. Such terms could only
be assented to by the Porte after complete and disastrous
defeat. They were indignantly rejected, and, much
against the wish of the Porte, the Congress came to an
end, and the Sultan was forced to take up arms in defence
of his Empire.</p>

<p>A Russian army of seventy thousand men, under Marshal
Munnich, opened the campaign of 1737 by an attack on
Oczakoff, the most important of the Ottoman fortresses
on the northern shores of the Black Sea, and General
Lascy, with forty thousand men, again invaded the Crimea.
Oczakoff was vigorously defended by twenty thousand
Turks. After some days of siege the principal powder
magazine in the fortress blew up, causing enormous destruction
and loss of life. The Turkish general, dismayed by
this, capitulated on favourable terms. But this did not
prevent the massacre of the greater part of the garrison,
and only three thousand of them survived. The losses of
the Russians, chiefly by disease, were also very great, and
nothing more was done by Munnich in this year’s campaign.
Meanwhile Lascy in the Crimea had repeated the
operation of Munnich of the previous year, and eventually
retreated from it.</p>

<p>The Austrians, on their part, invaded Bosnia and Serbia
with two armies. The principal one, under General
Seckendorf, attacked and captured Nisch and, later, Widdin.
But this exhausted their efforts for the year, and most of
their army perished from disease in the marshes of the
Danube.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1738 was little more decisive. The
Ottomans, with revived courage, took the offensive, and,
advancing into Hungary, under Grand Vizier Yegen
Mahomet, captured Semendria and Orsova. The
Austrians fell back on Belgrade. General Lascy again,
for a third time, invaded the Crimea, but the country had
been so devastated by the two previous invasions that he
could find no means there of feeding his army, and he
was soon compelled to withdraw. In the winter great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
efforts were made by the Porte to arrive at terms of
peace, and it was willing to make great sacrifices. But
Marshal Munnich vehemently opposed all peace proposals
at the Russian Court. He was still inflamed with the
desire to invade Turkey and to capture Constantinople.
At his instance emissaries were sent into the European
provinces of the Ottoman Empire to incite the Christian
rayas to rise in arms against their masters and oppressors—the
first instance of the kind.</p>

<p>On the opening of the campaign of 1739 Munnich led
his army through Podolia, a province then belonging to
Poland, whose neutrality he violated. He spread desolation
along his march, as though he were passing through
an enemy’s country. He crossed the frontier of Moldavia
and defeated a Turkish army at Khoczim, and then advanced
to Jassy, the capital of the province, and captured it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Austrians renewed their attack on Serbia
and Bosnia under two new generals, Wallis and Niepperg.
An army of fifty-six thousand Austrians issued from Peterwardein
and marched southwards, apparently in total
ignorance of the strength of the Turkish army which was
advancing to meet them. By great efforts the Porte had
raised and equipped an army of two hundred thousand
men, under the Grand Vizier Elhadji Mahomet. It
met the Austrian army at Krotzka, half-way between
Semendria and Peterwardein. The Austrians were defeated,
as was to be expected, in view of the enormous
disparity of the two armies. They fell back again on
Belgrade. The Ottomans followed up their victory and
commenced a bombardment of Belgrade.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the imbecility and infatuation of
the Austrian generals, Wallis and Niepperg. They were
now as anxious to make peace as they had been boastful
and bellicose at the commencement of the campaign. The
French Ambassador, Villeneuve, was with the Turkish
army. His mediation was accepted by the Austrians, and
terms of peace were agreed to, without consultation with
the Russian generals. Belgrade and all the parts of Serbia
and Bosnia which had been ceded to Austria by the treaty
of Passarowitch and a great part of Wallachia were restored
to the Ottoman Empire. The victory of the Ottomans
at Krotzka and, still more, the treaty of Belgrade which
followed, caused dismay and indignation to the victorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Russians in Moldavia. It was obviously impossible for
their army at Jassy to make any further advance into
Turkey, or even to hold its own in Moldavia, when an
Ottoman army of two hundred thousand, fresh from victory
over the Austrians, was on their flank on the Danube.
Munnich’s grandiose scheme for the capture of Constantinople
was extinguished. It became necessary for the
Czarina to follow the example of the Austrians and to
make peace with the Turks. Terms were ultimately
agreed to, under which the Russian conquests in Moldavia
and the Crimea and the city of Oczakoff were given up.
Russia retained only a narrow strip of land on the shores
of the Black Sea. The city of Azoff was to be demolished
and its territory was to form a belt of borderland, uncultivated
and desert, between the two Empires. The Russians
were prohibited from maintaining a fleet either in the Black
Sea or the Sea of Azoff.</p>

<p>The two treaties, as a result of the campaign of 1739,
were a triumph for Turkey. They were more due to the
imbecility and incapacity of the Austrian generals than to
the valour of the Ottomans, for it was no great feat of
arms for two hundred thousand Turks to defeat fifty-seven
thousand Austrians at the battle of Krotzka. But the
strategy of the Porte in concentrating their main force
against the Austrians on the Danube, while making little
resistance to the Russians in Moldavia, was fully justified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> campaign, and the resulting treaty of Belgrade, saved
the Ottoman Empire from further shrinkage for many years.
There followed a long period of peace. This was due not
merely to the fact that the Porte pursued a policy of
peace, but because the two great Powers in Europe, Russia
and Austria, who were bent on the dismemberment of
Turkey, were not in a condition to prosecute their aims,
and were not able to enter into any combination for the
purpose. In 1740 the Emperor Charles VI died. This
event led to a scramble among the neighbouring Powers
for his inheritance, and to the war known as that of the
Austrian Succession, which was brought to an end by the
Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. This was followed
later again by another war, known as the Seven Years
War, which was concluded in 1763. In neither of these
great wars did the Porte take any part, and it is to its credit
that it did not take advantage of them to attempt the
recovery from Austria of any of its lost dominions in
Hungary. Till war broke out with Russia in 1768 there
was profound peace.</p>

<p>Sultan Mahmoud died in 1754 and was succeeded by his
brother, Othman II, who reigned for three years only. He
was deformed—a hunchback. He does not appear to have
made any change in the foreign policy of his government.
In his three years of reign there were six Grand Viziers, and
it seems probable that the real power of the State was exercised
by the successor to the Kislaraga Bashir, from behind
the curtain of the harem.</p>

<p>Mustapha III succeeded his brother at the age of fifty.
He had spent his life up to this time in seclusion, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Cage of the Seraglio, cut off from all contact with, or even
knowledge of, public affairs. For the first six years of
his reign he left matters very much in the hands of his
Grand Vizier, Raghab Pasha, the last of the many who had
filled this post under Mahmoud. Raghab proved to be
a most wise and competent statesman, not far behind Sokolli
and the Kiuprilis, and, like them, devoted to a policy of
peace.</p>

<p>After the death of Raghab in 1763 Mustapha gradually
took into his own hands the reins of government. Though
well-intentioned and with a sense of public duty, he was
feeble, hasty, and impatient, and was wanting in the most
essential faculty of a ruler, that of selecting competent
men as generals and administrators. He abandoned the
policy of peace and allowed himself to be drawn into war,
with the most unfortunate results to his Empire. It was
his misfortune that his reign coincided with those of two
such able and unscrupulous neighbouring potentates as
Catherine II of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia.</p>

<p>The Empress Catherine was invested with supreme power
in Russia in the year 1762, in place of her worthless
husband, after a military revolt. At her instance, Russia
embarked on a policy of aggrandizement against both
Poland and Turkey. Frederick the Great also, who had
very recently favoured an alliance with the Porte with the
object of checking the advance of Russia, now reversed his
policy. In 1764 he made a treaty with the Russian Empress
reciprocally guaranteeing their possessions, and promising
assistance to one another, if the territories of either of
them were invaded. But if France were to attack Prussia,
or Turkey to attack Russia, assistance was to be given in
money. Very soon after this an agreement was arrived
at between these two Powers for the dismemberment of
Poland and the partition between them of part of its territory.
The Empress of Austria, Maria Theresa, also, though
most unwillingly, became a partner in this scheme. The
Porte was much opposed to this Polish policy of the three
conspirators. It protested strongly but in vain against the
occupation of Poland by Russian and Prussian troops and
against all the infamous proceedings which led to the first
partition of Poland. The Russian Government made no
effort to avert war. On the contrary, it showed by many
actions a deliberate intention to drive the Turks into war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
It fomented and encouraged rebellion against the Sultan
in the Crimea, the Morea, Montenegro, and Georgia. It
violated the neutrality of Turkey by pursuing Polish refugees
across the frontier of Bessarabia into territory belonging
to the Khan of the Crimea, a vassal of the Sultan, and
destroying there the town of Balta.</p>

<p>At a Divan held at Constantinople in October 1768 it
was decided that Russia, by its proceedings against Poland,
had broken the treaty of Belgrade, and that war against
her would be just and necessary. The only opposition to
this came from the Grand Vizier, Mouhsinzade Pasha. He
did not, indeed, object in principle, but he maintained that
it was most unwise to declare war until full preparations
had been made for it. He pointed out that the frontier
fortresses were in a most unprepared state, and that as
military operations could only be commenced by the Turks
in the next spring, Russia would be placed in an advantageous
position by an immediate declaration of war. For
this advice, which the sequel fully justified, the Grand
Vizier was dismissed from his office. In his place Emen
Mahomed was appointed—a most incompetent man, knowing
nothing about military matters, by his own admission.
As a result of this premature declaration of war, Russia
had full notice, and entered on the campaign of 1769 in
Moldavia before the Porte was ready to send an army to
defend that province. The Empress put into the field three
armies. The principal one, under command of Prince
Galitzin, invaded Moldavia and laid siege to Khoczim. It
was not till May 1769 that the Grand Vizier was in a
position to issue from his camp at Babatagli and march to
Isakdji, near Ismail. He there summoned his generals to
a council of war and opened the proceedings by an astounding
admission of incompetence. Asking for their opinion
as to what direction his army should be led, he said, “I
have no experience of war. It is for you to determine what
operation shall be undertaken and what are the most favourable
chances for the army and the Sublime Porte. Speak
without hesitation and enlighten me by your counsel.”</p>

<p>The generals were struck dumb with astonishment at
this confession of ignorance and impotence. Eventually a
discussion arose. There was great difference of opinion.
As a result, the only decision arrived at was to cross the
Danube into Moldavia, and then proceed as circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
might suggest. In fact, there was no definite plan of
campaign. The army, in accordance with this, crossed the
Danube. It was then decided to march to the River Pruth.
It reached a point about half-way between Khoczim and
Jassy. But already it suffered greatly from want of food,
for which no preparations had been made. The soldiers
also were harassed by swarms of mosquitoes in the marshes
of the Danube and the Pruth. It was unable to prevent
the capture of Khoczim by the Russians. It was ultimately
forced to retreat before coming into serious contact with
the enemy, and it found its way back to the Danube; and
thus concluded the campaign of 1769.</p>

<p>The Russians did little in the early part of 1770. Prince
Galitzin was almost as imbecile and incompetent as the
Grand Vizier. The Empress recalled him and appointed
in his place General Romanzoff, a most able and determined
soldier. The Sultan, on his part, recalled Emen Pasha and
gave orders for his execution.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Empress Catherine was engaged in
carrying out another part of her ‘Oriental project,’ as
it was called. She had sent numerous emissaries disguised
as priests to various parts of Greece with the object of
stirring up rebellion against the Sultan. Under the belief
that a general rising would take place, she sent a great
fleet from the Baltic to the Mediterranean for the purpose
of giving support to the insurgents. It consisted of twelve
ships of the line, twelve frigates, and numerous transports
conveying a military force. The expedition was under
the supreme command of Alexis Orloff, the brother of her
then lover, who had led the military revolt which placed
her on the throne. He had expectations that a throne
would be found for himself at the expense of the Turks.
The fleet was under virtual, though not nominal, command
of an Englishman, Admiral Elphinstone, who was supported
by numerous other British officers. It was said that every
vessel in the fleet had one of these officers on board. This
must have been with the cognizance and approval of the
British Government, which at that time favoured the aggrandizement
of Russia. This fleet left Cronstadt at the
end of 1769, and arrived off the coast of the Morea in
February 1770. It was welcomed by a large body of
insurgent Greeks (Mairotes) and a Russian force was landed.
The insurgents perpetrated the most atrocious acts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
cruelty on the comparatively few Turks resident in the
district.</p>

<p>The ex-Grand Vizier, Mouhsinzade Pasha, now Governor
of the Morea, showed great vigour. Collecting a force
of Albanians, he succeeded in defeating the insurgent
Greeks, fifteen thousand in number, and their Russian allies.
The Russians were compelled to re-embark in their fleet.
The Greeks who remained on shore were subjected to
ruthless slaughter, as were also the inhabitants of the
district. The whole countryside was devastated by the
Albanians. The Russian fleet, after ineffectual attempts
to capture Modon and Coron, sailed away. It came in
contact, off the island of Scios, with the Ottoman fleet, not
very unequal in number and size of vessels. A naval
battle took place on July 7, 1770, in which the Turks were
worsted. The defeat would have been the more serious
if it had not been for the extraordinary bravery of one of
their captains, Hassan of Algiers, who had gained experience
as a corsair. Laying his vessel alongside of that
of the Russian admiral, he fought with the utmost desperation
till both vessels were blown up.</p>

<p>The defeated fleet sought refuge in the small harbour of
Tchesmé, where it was blockaded by Admiral Elphinstone.
The British officers devised a scheme for destroying the
Turkish fleet. Lieutenant Dugdale volunteered to pilot a
fire-ship against them. Before coming to close quarters
the Russian sailors deserted the vessel, and Dugdale alone
remained on board. He steered the vessel against a
Turkish ship and set fire to it. The fire spread to the
other vessels, closely packed in the harbour, and the whole
of the Ottoman fleet was burnt and destroyed with the
exception of a single frigate. A more gallant and successful
attack has never been recorded in the annals of naval
warfare.</p>

<p>Elphinstone, who had fortunately escaped death—as did
also Hassan the Algerian, when their warships were blown
up in the recent naval battle—then advised that the Russian
fleet should sail without delay to the Dardanelles and force
its way through the Straits to the Sea of Marmora and
Constantinople. But Orloff hesitated and delayed, with
the result that the Turks, getting wind of the intention,
hastily erected four batteries at the Dardanelles, two on
either side of it, crossing their fire. These were sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
to make it impossible for the Russian fleet to force its
way through the Straits.</p>

<p>Orloff and the Russian fleet then proceeded to the island
of Lemnos, where it landed troops and besieged the chief
fortress. It was evidently hoped to secure a base for
the fleet in the Ægean Sea. After sixty days of siege the
garrison gave in, and terms of capitulation were agreed upon
with Orloff. In the meantime, however, Hassan had persuaded
the Porte to allow him to make a desperate effort
to save Lemnos. He enlisted four thousand ruffians at
Constantinople for this purpose. When it was pointed out
what a hazardous enterprise it was, the reply was that it
mattered little whether it was successful or not. If successful,
Lemnos would be saved; if unsuccessful, Constantinople
would be rid for ever of four thousand of its greatest
blackguards. Hassan landed unexpectedly in Lemnos, and,
declining to recognize the capitulation, attacked the Russians
and defeated them, and compelled them to take to their
ships again.</p>

<p>Hassan, after this successful exploit, was made Capitan
Pasha of the Ottoman navy. He managed to collect together
another fleet, and engaged the Russian fleet again off
Mondreso. Both fleets claimed victory, but it would seem
that the Russians had the worst of it, for they sheered off
and left these waters. When next heard of, the Russian
fleet was engaged in giving support to Ali Bey, the head of
the Mamelukes of Egypt, who had risen in rebellion against
the Turkish pasha there, and who was now invading Syria.
Orloff landed four hundred soldiers in Syria in support of
this rebel. But Ali Bey soon found himself in difficulties.
An outbreak took place in his own army against him,
fomented by his brother-in-law. Ali Bey was defeated and
put to death, and the four hundred Russians were slain in
battle. The Porte for a time recovered its hold on
Egypt.</p>

<p>The story of Orloff’s expedition has been told as it is
a good illustration of the use of a naval force which can
command the sea in a war of this kind, and of its inability
to undertake operations on land, or to force its way against
land batteries, unless supported by an adequate army.
Orloff’s fleet remained in the east of the Mediterranean till
the close of the war in 1773, but it did not effect anything
of importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>Reverting to the military operations on the Danube,
the autumn campaign of 1770 was very unfavourable to
the Ottoman cause. Khalil Pasha, who was now in command,
proved himself to be no more competent than his
predecessor. Romanzoff, in command of the Russian army,
overran the whole of Moldavia. Khalil led thirty thousand
efficient soldiers and a host of Tartar irregulars against
him. The two armies came in contact at Karkal, where
Khalil entrenched himself in front of the Russians, while his
Tartars ravaged the country behind them and threatened
their communications. Romanzoff then stormed the Turkish
line. The Turks fled in panic. Their camp and guns and
immense stores fell into the hands of the Russians. The
surviving Turks recrossed the Danube. At the close of
the campaign of 1770 all the Turkish fortresses north of
the Danube were in the hands of the Russians. The Grand
Vizier’s army was practically destroyed. Only two thousand
men were left to him under arms.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1771, still greater disasters
attended the Turks. Prince Dolgorouki, at the head of
eighty thousand Russians and sixty thousand irregular Tartars,
invaded the Crimea after storming successfully the lines
of Perekop. The whole province was overrun. Kertch
and Yenikale were captured. Wallachia and Moldavia
successively fell into the hands of the Russians. Khoczim
and Jassy were captured. The only gleams of success to the
Turks in this campaign were the recovery of Giurgevo
on the Danube and the successful defence of Oczakoff and
Kilburn on the shores of the Black Sea. In the Caucasus
the Russians were also successful and drove the Turks from
Georgia and Mingrelia.</p>

<p>These repeated successes of the Russians began to cause
alarm to Austria and Prussia, who by no means wished
for the undue aggrandizement of their neighbour. They
therefore attempted negotiations with Russia for mediation
on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. But the Empress
Catherine obstinately resisted anything in the way of
interference by other Powers, and made it known to the
Sultan that terms of peace must be settled with herself
alone. In his desperation the Sultan proposed to Austria
a joint partition of Poland as a bribe for assistance against
Russia, oblivious of the fact that he had entered upon war
with Russia on behalf of Poland. The offer was declined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
by the Emperor, not because he had any objection to a
scheme of plunder, but because he did not consider the
Porte to be in a position to become an effective partner in
such a scheme. As a matter of fact, Austria, Russia, and
Prussia were continually negotiating schemes for the dismemberment
either of Poland or Turkey, as might be most
convenient to them.</p>

<p>At the end of the campaign of 1771 an armistice was
agreed to between Russia and the Porte, and the greater part
of the following year was occupied in discussing terms of
peace at a conference or congress at Bucharest. An ultimatum
was eventually presented by Russia, embodying terms of
what might seem to be a very moderate character, in view
of the great success of her armies and the extent of territories
which they had practically conquered. The Sultan himself
and his Grand Vizier and principal ministers and generals
were in favour of accepting the terms as offered, but the
Mufti and the whole body of the ulemas were vehemently
opposed to them. The Divan therefore rejected them
and war was renewed. As these terms did not substantially
differ from those which were accepted two
years later, it is not worth while at this stage to explain
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there had been for more than a year a suspension
of hostilities, and a breathing time had been afforded
to the Porte, during which strenuous efforts were made for
another campaign. At the end of 1772, Mouhsinzade
Pasha, who had so distinguished himself in the defence
of the Morea, was again appointed Grand Vizier. He
infused new vigour into the army. In the spring of 1773,
when the negotiations at Bucharest were brought to a conclusion,
hostilities were recommenced. The campaign in
Europe, in this year, was confined within the quadrilateral
formed by the fortresses in Silistria and Rustchuk on the
Danube, the city of Varna on the Black Sea, and the great
fortress of Schumla to the north of the Balkan range.
There were several engagements between divisions of the
two armies in this district, in which the Turks were generally
worsted, but these victories were not of much avail to the
Russians so long as the three great fortresses of Silistria,
Varna, and Schumla remained in the hands of the
Turks.</p>

<p>The two main features of the campaign were the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>ful
defences by the Turks of Silistria and Varna against
overwhelming forces of Russians. General Romanzoff
crossed the Danube early in the year near Silistria. He
defeated a Turkish division and compelled it to retreat to
that fortress, where it added to its garrison. Romanzoff then
laid siege to it. His army stormed the outer defences
with the utmost vigour and succeeded in forcing them.
But their difficulties only then commenced. The Turks,
under command of Osman Pasha, maintained an heroic
resistance. The whole male population turned out in aid
of the army. They fought the advance of the Russians
street by street. In the end the Russians were compelled
to retreat, after the loss of eight thousand men. Later,
Romanzoff inflicted a severe defeat on the Turks at Korason.
This opened the way to Varna. But here again a successful
defence was offered by the Turkish garrison, supported
by the seamen of the Ottoman fleet in the Black Sea.
This was the closing scene of the campaign of 1773. Sultan
Mustapha died towards the close of this year, and was
succeeded by his brother, Abdul Hamid, who had been
secluded in the Cage for forty-eight years. As was to
be expected, he showed no capacity for the position to
which he was now at last called. He was, however, favourable
to peace, as was also Mouhsinzade, who was maintained
as Grand Vizier.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the campaign of 1774 the
Grand Vizier issued from his camp at Schumla with twenty-five
thousand men, with the intention of taking the offensive
and attacking the Russians at Hirsova, on the Danube.
The Russian forces in that district were under command of
Suvorov, who now and later was to show himself the
greatest general Russia had as yet produced. He did not
wait to be attacked by the Turks. He advanced from
Hirsova and met the Grand Vizier’s army at Kostlidji,
where he gained an overwhelming victory. The Turkish
camp and all its guns and stores were captured. The
defeated army dispersed, and the Grand Vizier found himself
with only eight thousand men to defend Schumla. The
Russians manœuvred so as to cut off the communications of
Schumla with the capital. Mouhsinzade thereupon asked
for an armistice. This was refused by the Russians, but
they were willing to discuss terms of peace. The assent
of the Porte was obtained by the Grand Vizier, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
July 16, 1774, after seven hours only of discussion between
plenipotentiaries at the village of Kainardji, a treaty of
peace was agreed to.</p>

<p>The terms were almost identical with those which had
been rejected by the Porte two years before, after the conference
at Bucharest. In view of the fact that the Ottoman
armies had been everywhere defeated during the war, and
that the Russians had obtained actual possession of the
Crimea, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Bessarabia in Europe,
and of Georgia and Mingrelia in the Caucasus, the terms
were distinctly moderate. The Empress must have been
very desirous of peace. There was a serious rebellion of
her southern provinces. Affairs in Poland were causing
her great anxiety. Her losses in the war with Turkey
had been very great, though her victories were many. It
was all-important to her that her hands should be free.
These were doubtless adequate reasons for moderation in
her terms to Turkey.</p>

<p>Under this treaty Russia gave up nearly all the Turkish
territory occupied by her armies. The Crimea was not,
indeed, restored to the Turks. The independence of the
Tartars there and in Bessarabia up to the frontier of Poland
was recognized under a native prince, in whose election
Russia and Turkey were forbidden to interfere. Neither
Power was thenceforth to “intervene in the domestic,
political, civil, and internal affairs of this new State.” There
was, however, a grave reservation pregnant of future
aggrandizement to Russia. She was to retain the fortresses
of Kertch, Yenikale, and the cities of Azoff and Kilburn.
These would necessarily give access to and virtual command
over the Crimea to Russia at any future time. For
the present, however, the Crimea, though lost to the Turks,
was not acquired by Russia. It is probable that the ulemas
would not have assented to the transfer of a Moslem
province to a Christian Power, and that the war would
have been continued if Russia had insisted on this.
Oczakoff, on the opposite side of the Dnieper to Kilburn,
was retained by the Porte. But the two Karbartas on the
shores of the Euxine, though inhabited by Moslems, were
retained by Russia. With these exceptions, all the Ottoman
territories in the hands of Russia as a result of the war—Wallachia,
Moldavia, Bessarabia, Georgia, and Mingrelia—were
restored to the Sultan. In the case of Wallachia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
and Moldavia, this retrocession was subject to the condition
that free exercise of the Christian religion was to
be secured to their population, and that there was to be
humane and generous government there for the future.
The right of remonstrance in these respects was secured
to the ministers of Russia at Constantinople on behalf of
these provinces.</p>

<p>Another most important clause, full of danger for the
future to the Ottoman Empire, related to its Christian subjects.
“The Sublime Porte,” it ran, “promises to protect
constantly the Christian religion and churches and allow
the ministers of Russia at Constantinople to make representation
on their behalf.”</p>

<p>This most important provision gave to Russia a preferential
right of protection of the Christian rayas not conceded
to any other Christian Power. Provision also was made
for the full access of Russian subjects to the holy city of
Jerusalem. Free navigation was provided for Russian ships
on the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, but nothing was
said as to a right of access through the Dardanelles and
Bosphorus. There was no mention of Poland in the treaty,
though it had been the original cause of the war. Two
secret clauses provided for the payment by the Porte of
four millions of roubles within three years and for the withdrawal
of the Russian fleet from the Archipelago.</p>

<p>The importance of this treaty, moderate though it was
in many of its terms, has always been recognized by historians
as the starting-point for further and greater dismemberments
of the Turkish Empire. The treaty of Carlowitz
had secured the deliverance of the Christian population
of Hungary from Ottoman rule. But this treaty now,
for the first time, tore from the Empire a Moslem province
and gave to Russia a right of intervention on behalf of
all the Christian population—an immense innovation,
humiliating to the Turks, and fraught with the gravest
peril to their Empire in the future.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Grand Vizier was fully
authorized by the Porte to agree to the terms of this treaty.
He was, however, recalled and deposed immediately after
its signature, and he died from the effects of poison on his
way to Constantinople. It was probably thought by the
ministers of the Sultan that Mouhsinzade, if called to account
for concluding so humiliating a treaty, would be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
show their full responsibility for it. It remains only to
state that the Russian plenipotentiaries at Kainardji delayed
the signature of the treaty for four days in order that it
might synchronize with the anniversary of the treaty of the
Pruth, which had been the cause of so much humiliation to
Russia.</p>

<h2><small>XVII</small><br /><br />

TO THE TREATY OF JASSY<br />

<small>1774-92</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighteen</span> years elapsed between the peace of Kainardji,
1774, and the treaty of Jassy, 1792, the next conspicuous
event in the downward course of the Ottoman Empire.
The first thirteen of these years were a period of external
peace to the Empire under the rule of Abdul Hamid I.
The country had been completely exhausted by the late
war with Russia, and the Sultan—or, rather, his ministers,
for he appears to have been little competent himself to
carry on the government—were strongly in favour of maintaining
peace, and did so in spite of great provocation
from the Empress Catherine. That able and unscrupulous
woman pursued her designs for the complete subjection of
the Crimea with relentless resolution and activity. It was an
essential condition of the peace of Kainardji that the Crimea
was to be an independent State under the rule of a native
Tartar prince. The breach of it, by the assumption of
sovereignty, direct or indirect, on the part of Russia, would
undoubtedly be a just cause of war to the Turks. The
Porte, however, was not in a position to take up a
challenge of the Empress. The knowledge of this was
doubtless the main motive for her proceedings during the
next few years.</p>

<p>The steps by which Catherine attained her object bore
a striking resemblance to those by which other annexations
were carried into effect by Russia, and might well
have been predicted. A member of the princely Tartar
family of Gherai, Dewlet, was elected by the Tartars of
the Crimea as their Khan. The agents of Russia thereupon
supported the claims of a rival Gherai, Schahin. They
fomented disaffection and revolt against Dewlet. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
sedulously disclaiming any project of annexation, Catherine
then sent an army into the peninsula with the ostensible
purpose of restoring order. It compelled the abdication
of Dewlet and the election of her nominee, Schahin. This
prince, raised to the throne by Russian arms, found it
necessary to follow the advice of the Russian agent, and
soon made himself most unpopular with his subjects. A
revolt took place against him. He appealed to the Empress
for assistance. A Russian army again appeared in the
guise of pacificator. The Tartars who opposed were
slaughtered or driven from the country. Schahin was compelled
to resign his throne, and the Empress thereupon
proclaimed the annexation of the Crimea, with professions
of acting only for the benefit of its people and to save them
from misgovernment. The wretched tool Schahin was imprisoned
for a time in Russia, and later was expelled the
country into Turkey, where he was speedily put to death.
The Porte was unable to undertake a war on behalf of the
independence of the Tartars, and in 1784 a new treaty was
made between the two Powers, recognizing the sovereignty
of Russia over the Crimea and a district along the north
of the Euxine inhabited by Tartars.</p>

<p>Later, there were many indications of the intention of
Catherine to exploit her wider project of driving the Turks
from Europe. In 1779, when a second grandson was born
to her, the name of Constantine was given to him. Greek
women were provided for him as nurses, and he was taught
the Greek language. Everything was done to stimulate
the hope that there would be a revival of a Greek Empire
at Constantinople, in substitution for that of the Ottomans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was a succession of grave internal
troubles in Turkey, fomented in part by emissaries from
Russia. The brave old Hassan of Algiers, now Capitan
Pasha, who had the complete confidence of the Sultan,
was continually being called upon to put down revolts.
Thus in 1776 he defeated the Sheik Jahir, who had revolted
in Syria. In 1778 he was engaged in expelling from
the Morea the rebellious Albanians, who had been employed
against Orloff in his invasion of that province, and who,
after his defeat, had remained in the Morea, establishing
themselves in a lawless ascendancy there, oppressing,
plundering, and slaughtering Turks and Greeks alike without
discrimination. Hassan succeeded in defeating and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
expelling these wild ruffians. Later, Hassan was employed
in putting down a rebellion of the Mamelukes in Egypt.
He led an army there, and succeeded in restoring the
authority of the Sultan. In 1787 he was again recalled
to Constantinople, on the imminence of war with Russia,
and at the age of seventy-five was employed for a time
in command of the Turkish fleet in the Black Sea and
later as commander-in-chief of the army. It will be seen
that for the first time in his life his good fortune deserted
him and that he met with serious defeats.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that the Empress Catherine
was very provocative in her policy and action to Turkey.
In 1787 an agreement was arrived at between Catherine
and Joseph II, Emperor of Austria, for common action
against the Turks, and with the deliberate intention of
driving them from Europe. A partition was to be made of
their European provinces between the two Powers and a
Greek Empire was to be set up at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The Empress made a triumphal progress through the
Crimea, under the auspices of her favourite and paramour,
Prince Potemkin, to whose efforts its annexation had been
mainly due. The Emperor Joseph met her on the way
there at Kherson, and hatched with her a scheme of war
with Turkey. A triumphal arch was erected, with the
inscription, “This is the way to Byzantium.” Emissaries
were sent to stir up rebellion in Wallachia and Moldavia.
Claims were raised officially against Turkey for the
province of Bessarabia and the fortress of Oczakoff, on
the ground that they had formerly been part of the domains
of the Khans of the Crimea. These claims greatly irritated
the Turks. The few years of peace had renovated them.
They were now ambitious of recovering the city of Kilburn,
and even had hopes of regaining the Crimea. Popular
feeling was aroused, and at the instance of the Divan,
and without waiting to make preparations for the defence
of the frontier fortresses, the Sultan declared war against
Russia on August 15, 1787.</p>

<p>A large force was then sent by the Porte to Oczakoff, the
fortress on the embouchure of the Dniester, with the intention
of attacking Kilburn on the opposite side. A fleet
was sent, under Hassan, to co-operate with it, and to
convey the army across the river to Kilburn. Unfortunately
for the Turks, the Russian force at Kilburn was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
under the command of Suvorov, a military genius of the
first rank. He allowed the larger half of the Turkish
army to be conveyed across the river and then attacked it
by land, while a flotilla of gunboats from Nicholaif engaged
the Turkish fleet. This strategy was completely successful.
The Ottoman force of eight thousand men landed
on the Kilburn side was overwhelmed and slaughtered.
Nearly the whole of Hassan’s fleet was destroyed. The
attack on Kilburn was completely defeated.</p>

<p>Nothing more was effected by either of the two combatants
in 1787. At the beginning of the next year,
1788, the Emperor of Austria, on February 10th, declared
war against Turkey without any provocation. He had been
delayed fulfilling his agreement with Catherine by disturbances
in his own dominions. He was now free to
carry out his undertaking. The Turks, therefore, found
themselves confronted by two formidable enemies. Fortunately
for them, Russia was prevented putting forth its
full strength in the south, in consequence of war having
broken out with Sweden. The Empress was unable on
this account to carry out her engagement with the Emperor
to send an army into Moldavia in support of that of the
Austrians. Nor was she able to send a fleet into the Ægean
Sea, as had been promised. But Joseph took command
himself of an army of two hundred thousand men with
which to attack the Turks. He soon proved himself to
be the most incompetent of generals. The only defeat he
was able to inflict was upon his own soldiers, under circumstances
unprecedented in war.</p>

<p>The Turks, when they found that there was no danger
of any advance on the part of the Russians, sent a great
army across the Danube, which encountered and defeated
an Austrian army, under Wartersleben, at Mendia. Joseph
then marched to relieve this defeated force and to protect
Hungary. He took up a position with eighty thousand men
at Slatina, within easy reach of the Grand Vizier’s army.
At the last moment, when all the preparations had been
made to attack the Ottomans, the Emperor took alarm.
He abandoned his project of attack, and retreated in the
direction of Temesvar. The retreat was begun at midnight.
Great confusion took place. An alarm was spread
that the Turks were close at hand and were about to
attack. The wildest panic occurred. The Austrian artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
was driven at full speed in retreat. The infantry mistook
them for the enemy. They formed themselves into
small squares for defence, and began to fire wildly in all
directions. In the early morning, when the sun rose, it
was discovered that these squares had been firing into one
another, with the result that ten thousand men were <i>hors
de combat</i>. The Turks now came up and made a real
attack. They defeated the Austrians and captured a great
part of their artillery and baggage. No other engagement
took place in this direction in the course of this year.
The Emperor lost thirty thousand men in his attempted
manœuvre and forty thousand by disease. He never again
ventured to command an army.</p>

<p>Little was attempted in 1788 by the Russians till August,
when Potemkin found himself in a position to invest
Oczakoff. The siege was protracted till December, when
Suvorov was called in to assist. Under his spirited advice,
an assault was made on the fortress, and, in spite of
enormous losses, the Russians overcame all opposition and
entered the city. A frightful scene of carnage then
occurred. The city was given over to the Russian soldiers.
Of a population of forty thousand only a few hundreds
escaped death, and twenty thousand of the garrison were
slaughtered. In spite of this great loss, the campaign of
1788 had not been altogether to the detriment of the
Turks. Though they lost Oczakoff, and all hopes of recovering
Kilburn and the Crimea had vanished, they had
successfully resisted Austria. Joseph’s attack had ignominiously
failed.</p>

<p>The campaign of the following year was far more
disastrous to the Turks. Early in 1789 Sultan Abdul
Hamid died, and was succeeded by his nephew, Selim III,
a young man of twenty-seven, of vigour and public spirit.
He had not been subjected by his uncle, Abdul Hamid, to
the debasing seclusion which had for so long been the
fate of heirs to the throne. He had been allowed much
freedom. His father, Mustapha, had left him a memoir,
pointing out the dangers of the State, and advising extensive
reforms, and the young man had deeply studied
this. He was fully conscious of the necessity for
radical changes, and though he very wisely did not attempt
to lead his troops in the field, he spared no effort to
improve the condition of the army and to stimulate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
warlike zeal of his subjects. He sent the immense accumulation
of plate in his palace to the Mint, and he persuaded
the ladies of the harem to give up their jewellery in aid
of the treasury. He was ardently in favour of reforms in
all directions. He deserved a better fate than was in
store for him. It will be seen that his reign was one of
most bitter reverses.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Turks, ill-health prevented the
Emperor Joseph from again taking the field in command
of the Austrian army. He was replaced by Marshal
Loudon—a veteran of the Seven Years War, a Scotsman
by race, who had risen from the ranks and had deservedly
won great reputation. It was said of him that he “made
war like a gentleman.” He was noted for his quick
decision on the field of battle, and though over seventy-five
was still in full vigour. A new spirit was infused into
the Austrian army. A part of it under Marshal Loudon
invaded Bosnia and Serbia, where it met with brilliant
success. In Bosnia it was stoutly resisted by the Moslem
population. In Serbia it met with cordial co-operation
of the rayas, who detested their Moslem oppressors. The
greater part of these two provinces was occupied. Another
Austrian army, under the Prince of Coburg, was directed
to Moldavia to act in concert with the Russian army,
under Suvorov. The Sultan, on his part, appointed
Hassan as Grand Vizier and commander-in-chief of the
army. Hassan was not equal to the task of confronting such
a general as Suvorov. He advanced with a large army
against Coburg, who was stationed at Fokshani, on the
frontier of Moldavia. Coburg would have been overwhelmed
by the superior force of the Turks had it not
been for the wonderful activity of Suvorov, who marched
sixty miles through a difficult and mountainous country in
thirty-six hours to relieve the Austrians. Suvorov, immediately
on arrival, late in the afternoon, made preparations
for attacking the Ottoman army. Two hours before daylight
the next day he assaulted the fortified camp of the
Turks. Never was a bold course more completely justified.
The camp was carried by the Russians with the bayonet.
The Turks lost all their artillery and immense stores.
Another great army was sent by Selim and was also utterly
defeated by Suvorov on the River Rimnik in September
of the same year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>These two serious defeats caused panic at Constantinople.
To allay this the Sultan, to his infinite discredit, gave
orders for the execution of the brave old Hassan—the
victor in so many battles, whose advice for the better
training of the Janissaries had been cruelly neglected. But
it was the habit of the Turks to attribute every defeat
to the treason of the general and to put him to death,
just as the Convention at Paris, during the revolutionary
wars, sent to the guillotine the generals who failed—not,
it must be admitted, without some result in stimulating
others to better efforts.</p>

<p>Farther to the west, Belgrade and Semendria were
captured by the Austrians in this campaign of 1789. In
the following year the tide of victory on the part of the
Russians and Austrians was stayed by two events. The
one was that the Emperor Joseph found it necessary, in
consequence of outbreaks in almost every part of his own
dominions, caused by his hasty and ill-considered measures
of centralization, in defiance of all local customs, to hold
his hand against the Turks, and withdraw his conquering
armies in order to employ them in putting down revolution
at home. His death occurred early in 1790. Leopold,
who succeeded, a wise and sagacious ruler, the very opposite
to Joseph, reversed the policy of his brother. He did
not favour a Russian alliance against Turkey.</p>

<p>Another cause of Austria withdrawing from the war was
the entry into the field of politics in the east of Europe
of England, Prussia, and Holland. These Powers had
formed a close defensive alliance, and had already exercised
great influence by joint action. They had extinguished
French influence in Holland. They had intervened with
good effect between Russia and Sweden and had brought
about peace between them. They now proposed mediation
between Austria and Turkey, not without threats of
stronger action. An armistice was agreed to between these
Powers. The death of Joseph greatly facilitated an
arrangement. Terms were agreed upon with the Turks,
and were ultimately embodied in the treaty of Sistova,
on the principle of the <i>status quo</i> before the war,
under which all the territory which Austria had occupied
in Bosnia, Serbia, and Wallachia, including the fortresses
of Belgrade and Semendria, were given back to Turkey,
with the exception of a small strip of land in Croatia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
the town of Old Orsova. The acquisitions by Austria
were of very small importance and made but a poor
return for the great effort put forth in the war. But the
new Emperor, Leopold, did not think that Austria had anything
to gain by the dismemberment of either Turkey or
Poland. Had he lived, subsequent events might have turned
out differently, and Poland, in all probability, would not
have been victimized.</p>

<p>The defection of Austria from the alliance with Russia
against the Turks was a very serious matter for the
Empress Catherine. It was balanced, however, in part,
by peace with Sweden, which enabled her to use her whole
force on land and sea against her remaining enemy. She
still adhered to the project of driving the Turks from
Europe, and reconstituting a Greek Empire at Constantinople.
She sent numerous emissaries to Greece to
persuade its people “to take up arms and co-operate with
her in expelling the enemies of Christianity from the
countries they had usurped, and in regaining for the
Greeks their ancient liberty and independence.”</p>

<p>Early in 1790 she received a deputation at St. Petersburg
from some leading Greeks. They presented a
petition to her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have never [it said] asked for your treasure; we do not ask for it
now; we only ask for powder and shot, which we cannot purchase, and to
be led to battle.... It is under your auspices that we hope to deliver
from the hands of barbaric Moslems an Empire which they have usurped,
to free the descendants of Athens and Lacedæmon from the tyrannous
yoke of ignorant savages—a nation whose genius is not extinguished,
which glows with the love of liberty, which the iron yoke of barbarism
has not destroyed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Empress, in reply, promised to give the assistance
they asked for. They were then presented to the young
Prince Constantine, who replied to them in the Greek
language: “Go, and let everything be done according
to your wishes.”</p>

<p>The wealthier Greeks in the Levant had already fitted
out a squadron of thirteen frigates in support of their
cause. These were now, by order of the Empress, supplied
with guns at Trieste and were put under command
of a brave Greek admiral, Lambro Caviziani. This
squadron, when fitted out, made its way to the Ægean Sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
where it made its base in the Isle of Scios. The Turkish
fleet in those waters was at a low ebb. The best of the
Turkish vessels were being employed in the Black Sea.
But seven Algerine corsairs came to the assistance of the
Porte, and, in concert with some Turkish ships, fought a
naval battle with the Greek squadron and sank the whole
of its vessels.</p>

<p>The Russian army on land was more fortunate. Their
chief operation in 1790 was the capture of Ismail, a most
important fortress on the northern affluent of the Danube,
about forty miles from the Black Sea. So long as this
city was in the hands of the Turks an advance of an
invading army from Bessarabia into Bulgaria was hardly
possible. The fortress was defended by a very large
garrison. Suvorov was again put at the head of a <i>corps
d’armée</i> by Potemkin, the commander-in-chief, with the
laconic order, “You will capture Ismail, whatever may
be the cost.” Six days after his arrival before the
fortress, Suvorov ordered his troops to assault it. Speaking
to them in his usual jocular manner, he said: “My
brothers, no quarter; provisions are scarce.” At a terrible
cost of life the city was taken by storm. A scene of
savage carnage ensued, unprecedented even in the experience
of Suvorov. Thirty-four thousand Turks perished.
Suvorov admitted to a friend that he was moved to tears
when the scene was over. But he was accustomed to shed
these crocodile tears after horrors of this kind, when he
had made no effort to mitigate them. When news of the
achievement arrived at St. Petersburg, the Empress, at
her levée, addressing the British Ambassador, Sir C. Whitworth,
said, with an ironic smile: “I hope that those who
wish to drive me out of St. Petersburg will allow me to
retire to Constantinople.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the allied maritime Powers—England, Prussia,
and Holland—having succeeded in their mediation between
Austria and Turkey, and in restoring peace between them,
on the basis of the <i>status quo</i>, were now engaged in
efforts of the same kind as between Russia and Turkey.
They offered mediation to the Empress Catherine in the
course of 1790. In a reply to the Prussian King, she
indignantly rejected intervention. “The Empress,” she
said, “makes war and makes peace when she pleases.
She will not permit any interference whatever in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
management or government of her affairs.” It was understood,
however, that she was not disinclined to peace upon
the terms that Oczakoff and the district between the Rivers
Dniester and Bug, which were in her full possession, were
to be retained by her, and that all other of her conquests
were to be restored to Turkey. The allied Powers were
unwilling to assent to this, and made preparations for an
armed mediation to compel Russia to restore Oczakoff to
Turkey.</p>

<p>In the case of Great Britain, the proposed intervention
on behalf of the Turks in support of their Empire was
a new departure in policy. Its Government had been
closely allied with that of Russia during the greater part
of the eighteenth century. Its policy had been mainly
determined by jealousy of France. It looked upon Russia
as a counterpoise to that State. It had never raised any
objection to the ambitious projects of Russia against
Turkey. Lord Chatham, whose foreign policy had prevailed
till now, had always held that it was not the
interest of England to enter into a connection with the
Turks. England had looked on with indifference in 1784,
when the Empress Catherine had taken possession of the
Crimea. Charles Fox was at that time Minister of Foreign
Affairs in England, and he showed himself as much in
favour of Russia as Chatham had been. “My system
of foreign politics,” he wrote, “is deeply rooted. Alliance
with the northern Powers (including Russia) ever has
been and ever will be the system of every enlightened
Englishman.” It was an entirely new departure when the
younger Pitt, in 1790, entered the lists in alliance with
Prussia against Russia in order to restore and maintain
the balance of power in the south-east of Europe in favour
of Turkey.</p>

<p>The British Government renewed its offer of mediation.
Its Ambassador at St. Petersburg was instructed to inform
the Empress that if she would accept a peace on the basis
of the <i>status quo</i>, England would use her influence to
obtain from the Turks a formal renunciation of their claims
to the Crimea under the guarantee of the allies. The
Empress, in her reply through her minister, expressed her
indignation at the unparalleled conduct of the allies in
attempting to dictate in so arbitrary a manner to a sovereign
perfectly independent, and in want of no assistance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
procure the conditions which seemed to her best suited
to satisfy her honour. Rather than diminish the glory of
a long and illustrious reign, the Empress was ready to
encounter any risk, and she would only accept the good
offices of the King of England “inasmuch as they may
lead to preserve for her the indemnification she requires
of Oczakoff and its district.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The reply was important, for it showed that Russia was,
at all events, willing to bring the war to an end and to
forgo its intention of driving the Turks out of Europe.
The fact was that, in spite of repeated victories, the Russian
losses in killed and wounded, and still more by disease,
were very serious. The Empress also had other troubles
on her hands. The Polish question, in which she was
more interested than in that of Turkey, was imminent.
The Second Partition was decided on. It was necessary for
her to have a free hand. In spite of this, she was
determined not to yield possession of Oczakoff.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British and Prussian Governments were
in consultation. They were agreed that they were bound
to insist upon the surrender of Oczakoff and its district,
and upon a peace based on the <i>status quo</i> before the
war. It was contended that, as Austria and Sweden had
both made peace on such terms, the allies could not with
honour demand less for the Turks, and that Turkey would
consider itself betrayed if the allies were willing to give
up those districts.</p>

<p>It was decided, therefore, by the allies to enforce by
arms their mediation on the basis of the <i>status quo</i>. The
British Government engaged to send a fleet of thirty-five
vessels of the line into the Baltic, and Prussia to march
an army into Livonia. It was agreed that neither Power
would look for any territorial acquisition, but would
only insist on greater security for the Porte in the
Black Sea.</p>

<p>In this view Mr. Pitt, on March 28, 1791, presented to
the House of Commons a message from the King asking
for the supply of means to augment the forces of the
Crown. He based his justification, says Mr. Lecky, who
has given a summary of Pitt’s speech, mainly on the
interests of Prussia and the obligation of Great Britain
to defend her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Prussia [Pitt said], of all European Powers, is the one who would be
the most useful ally of England, and the events that were taking place
were very dangerous to her. The Turkish Empire is of great weight in
the general scale of European Powers, and if that Empire is diminished or
destroyed, or even rendered unstable or precarious, the situation of Prussia
would be seriously affected.... Could any one imagine that the
aggrandizement of Russia would not materially affect the disposition of
other Powers—that it might not produce an alteration in Poland highly
dangerous to Prussia?... If a powerful and ambitious neighbour
were suffered to establish herself upon the very frontier of Prussia, what
safety was there for Denmark, or what for Sweden when Prussia shall no
longer be in a position to help them? The safety of all Europe might
afterwards be endangered. Whatever might be the result of the war in
which the Turks were now unhappily engaged, if its results were to
increase the power of Russia the effect would not be confined to the
two Powers alone; it would be felt by the rest of Europe.</p></blockquote>

<p>He asked for the means to equip a great fleet to be
sent to the Baltic and a smaller one for the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The proposal of Pitt for giving effect to this policy was
violently opposed by Charles Fox in a speech which produced
a very great effect in the House of Commons and
on the country.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The insistence [he said] on the surrender by Russia of Oczakoff and its
district was in the highest degree unjust and impolitic. It was unjust
because Russia had not been the aggressor in the war and because, in
spite of her great successes, she had consented to concessions which
displayed her signal moderation. It was impolitic, for the only result of
an expensive and dangerous war would be to alienate, perhaps for ever,
a most valuable ally, without obtaining any object in which England had
a real interest.... Russia was the natural ally of England. What had
England to gain by this policy? In what way could English interests or
English power be affected by the acquisition by Russia of a fortress on
the Dniester and a strip of barren land along the northern shore of the
Black Sea?... The assertion that England was bound by the spirit of
its defensive alliance with Prussia was in the highest degree dangerous
and absurd. If defensive alliances were construed in such a way they
would have all the evils of offensive alliances, and they would involve us in
every quarrel in Europe. We bound ourselves only to furnish assistance
to Prussia if she were attacked. She had not been attacked. She was at
perfect peace. She was absolutely unmenaced. It was doubtful whether
the new acquisition of Russia would under any circumstances be injurious
to Prussia, and it was preposterous to maintain that it was the duty of
England to prevent any other nations from acquiring any territory which
might possibly in some future war be made use of against Prussia.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>Fox was supported by Burke in a powerful speech, in
spite of their growing differences on the subject of the
Revolution in France.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Considering the Turkish Empire [he said] as any part of the balance of
power in Europe was new. The Turks were essentially Asiatic people,
who completely isolated themselves from European affairs. The minister
and the policy which should give them any weight in Europe would
deserve all the ban and curses of posterity. For his part, he confessed
that he had seen with horror the beautiful countries that bordered on the
Danube given back by the Emperor of Austria to devastation. Are we
now going to vote the blood and treasure of our countrymen to enforce
similar cruel and inhuman policy?... That so wise a man as Pitt
should endeavour, on such slight and frivolous grounds, to commit this
country to a policy of unlimited adventure, sacrificing the friendship of
one of our oldest allies and casting to the winds the foreign policy of his
own father, was the most extraordinary event that had taken place in
Parliament since he had sat within its walls.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pitt’s motion was carried, but by many votes short of
his usual party majority. Two other debates took place on
the subject. Though Pitt maintained his majority, it was
evident that the opinion of the House of Commons, and still
more of the country, was opposed to going to war with
Russia on behalf of Turkey. Pitt very wisely decided to
abandon his policy of war. He withdrew his proposal in
the House of Commons. The Foreign Minister, the Duke
of Leeds, who was personally committed to it, resigned his
office. Another messenger was sent to the British Ambassador
at St. Petersburg with instructions not to present the
menacing despatch to the Czar, and, fortunately, arrived in
time to prevent it.</p>

<p>Sir E. Creasy describes the action of Charles Fox in
thus defeating the policy of Pitt as due to violent and unscrupulous
party motives, and Mr. Lecky, while agreeing
in substance with the arguments of Fox, and condemning
Pitt’s policy, does not acquit the former of political partisanship.
He never loses an opportunity of impeaching the
conduct of Charles Fox, on account of his action in the
war with the American colonies and in the revolutionary
war with France. It may be permitted to us to say, in
spite of these high authorities, that seldom has a greater
service been done to the country than in the defeat of Pitt’s
proposal to go to war with Russia on this occasion. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
was a unique case in our constitutional history when the
House of Commons by its debates, and not by its votes,
defeated a proposal for war made to it by a Prime Minister,
with all the authority of the Crown and the Government.
The merit of this was mainly due to Fox.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Turks were incurring further defeats
on the Danube. They made desperate efforts to replenish
their armies, but the men were ill-trained and were unable
to meet the veteran troops of Russia. Kutusoff, at the head
of a Russian army, routed a great Ottoman army at
Babatagh in January 1791, and in July of the same year
Prince Repnin, with forty thousand Russians, defeated and
dispersed seventy thousand Turks at Maksyu, on the southern
bank of the Danube. The Turks were equally unfortunate
on the east of the Black Sea. A Russian army invaded
the province of Kuban and defeated a Turkish army there,
and occupied the whole of the province.</p>

<p>As a result of all these reverses the Divan was dispirited.
There was no prospect of assistance to Turkey from any
quarter. They were willing to come to terms. The
Empress, on her part, was equally willing. She wanted
her army to march into Poland to put down an outbreak
of the Poles, under Kosciuszko. In spite of her recent
victories, which had secured to her the occupation of
Bessarabia, Moldavia, Wallachia, and the Kuban, she was
ready to give up all with the exception of the fortress of
Oczakoff and the country between the Rivers Dniester and
Bug. Terms on this basis, and without any mediation
or interference of other Powers, were agreed on between
Russia and Turkey in August, 1791, and were embodied
in the treaty of Jassy in January of the following year.
Under this treaty the River Dniester was the new boundary
of the Russian Empire, and all conquests west of it were
restored to the Turks. Russia also gave back the province
of Kuban, but the treaty recognized the Empress as the protector
of the petty independent principalities in that region.</p>

<p>The project of carving for Potemkin a kingdom out of
the Danubian principalities was abandoned, and that of a
Greek Empire at Constantinople was indefinitely adjourned.
Potemkin, who was a Pole by birth and had been raised
from the position of a sergeant in the Russian army to
princely rank with a fortune estimated at seven millions of
our money, died a few days after the treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>In the next four years the Empress achieved the final
partition of Poland, and obtained for Russia the lion’s
share. Had she lived, she would probably have used her
acquisitions there as a vantage-ground for new aggressions
on the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile Greece was abandoned
to the tender mercies of its oppressors.</p>

<h2><small>XVIII</small><br /><br />

TO THE TREATY OF BUCHAREST<br />

<small>1792-1812</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty</span> years after the treaty of Jassy, another slice of
the Ottoman territory was ceded to Russia in 1812 by the
treaty of Bucharest. The history of Turkey during the
interval is full of interest in its relation to the Napoleonic
wars, but much of it has little bearing on the shrinkage of
the Empire.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the war with Russia in 1792,
Sultan Selim was most anxious to maintain peace and to
keep out of the complications arising from the French
Revolution. He was fully conscious of the necessity for
reforms in every branch of the administration of his country,
and especially in the constitution and training of the army.
He regarded the Janissaries as a grave danger to the
State. He initiated many great schemes of reform. But
in 1798 these were nipped in the bud by a fresh outbreak
of hostilities. War was forced upon him most unexpectedly,
and without just cause or even pretext, by the Revolutionary
Government of France, a country whose traditional policy
had been to support the Ottoman Empire against that of
Austria. France had recently become a near neighbour
to Turkey. Under the treaty of Campo-Formio in 1797,
after the great victories of General Bonaparte in Italy,
the Republic of Venice ceased to exist. Venice itself,
and much of its Italian territories, were subjected to the
rule of Austria, and its possessions in the Adriatic, the
Ionian Islands, and the cities on the mainland, such as
Prevesa and Parga, were ceded to France. This change
of masters was welcomed by the inhabitants of the islands,
who were weary of the tyranny of the Venetians.</p>

<p>The Directory, which then ruled in France, was filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
with ambition for further extensions in the East. It was
under the impression that the Ottoman Empire was on
the point of complete dissolution. There was much, at
the time, to justify this view. The central power of the
State was almost paralysed. The pashas of many provinces,
such as Ali of Janina, Passhwan Oghlou of Widdin, and
Djezzar of Acre, had made themselves all but independent
of the Sultan. Egypt was virtually ruled by the Mamelukes.
Its pasha, appointed by the Porte, was without any authority.
Serbia and Greece were seething with rebellion. Bonaparte,
while commanding the army in Italy, sent emissaries to
several of these provinces, and especially to Greece, holding
out hopes of support in the event of open rebellion. It
seemed at first as though his ambition was for extension of
French dominion in Greece and other European provinces
of the Porte. An army of forty thousand men, including
the best of the veterans who had fought in Italy, was
mobilized at Toulon. Two hundred transports were prepared
to convey them to some unknown destination, and
a powerful fleet of fifteen battleships and fifteen frigates
was ordered to act as convoy. At the last moment the
Directory, at the instance of Bonaparte, decided on the
invasion of Egypt. A blow was to be struck there, not
against the Porte, but against England, with whom France
was at war. There were vague intentions or dreams, after
the conquest of Egypt, of invading India and founding
a great Eastern Empire for France on the ruins of the
British Empire. It was pretended that the attack on Egypt
was not an act of hostility to the Porte. Egypt, it was
said, was to be delivered from the cruel and corrupt government
of the Mamelukes. There was no declaration of
war against the Sultan. It was expected that he would
acquiesce in the suppression of the Mamelukes.</p>

<p>The utmost secrecy was maintained as to the destination
of the expedition. It left Toulon on May 19, 1798, under
the command of Bonaparte. He took with him many of
the ablest generals who had served under him in Italy and
a large party of ‘savants,’ who were to explore the monuments
of Egypt. The orders from the Directory to
Bonaparte, drawn up doubtless by himself, were</p>

<blockquote>

<p>to clear the English from all their Oriental possessions which he will be
able to reach, and notably to destroy all their stations in the Red Sea;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>to cut through the Isthmus of Suez and to take the necessary measures to
assure the free and exclusive possession of that sea to the French
Republic.</p></blockquote>

<p>The destination of this great fleet and army was unknown
to the British Government. But there was a strong British
fleet at the entrance of the Mediterranean, under Lord St.
Vincent, who detached a large part of it, under command
of Nelson, to watch the issue of the French fleet from
Toulon. It was composed of an equal number of battleships
to that of the French fleet, but of inferior size, and
with fewer guns. It was very deficient in frigates.</p>

<p>On June 10th, three weeks after escaping from Toulon, the
French fleet arrived at Malta. The Knights of St. John, who
had made so valiant and successful a defence of the island
against the Ottomans in 1565, now offered a very feeble
resistance to the French. The knightly monks had become
licentious and corrupt. They very soon capitulated.
Bonaparte annexed the island to France, and the ancient
Order came to an ignominious end.</p>

<p>Leaving four thousand men at Malta, the fleet sailed for
the island of Crete, and hearing there that Nelson was
in pursuit, Bonaparte at once decided to sail to Alexandria.
He then for the first time announced to the army its
destination.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Soldiers [he said in a proclamation], you go to undertake a conquest
of which the effects upon the civilization and the commerce of the world
will be incalculable. You will strike at England the most certain and the
most acute blow, while waiting to give her the death-blow.... The
Mamelukes, who favour exclusively English commerce, some days after
your arrival will exist no more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nelson meanwhile, when he discovered the departure of
the French fleet from Toulon, shrewdly guessed that it
was bound to Egypt, and bent his course there, hoping to
find the enemy’s ships at Alexandria. He arrived there on
June 28th, before the French fleet, and, hearing nothing of
it, he doubled back to Sicily. The two fleets crossed one
another not far from Crete, and within sight of one another
if the weather had been bright; but a dense haze and
the want of frigates to act as scouts prevented Nelson
discovering the proximity of his enemy. But for this it
is certain that the French fleet, encumbered as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
with two hundred transports, would have been totally
destroyed and the whole armada would have met with
unparalleled disaster. It is interesting matter for speculation
what effect this would have had on the career of the
Corsican general and on the history of Europe. As it
was, the French fleet and army, favoured by their extraordinary
good luck, arrived safely at Alexandria on July 1st.
The army disembarked there. The battleships, not being
able to get into the harbour, were anchored in Aboukir
Bay. Alexandria was captured, after a slight resistance
by its small garrison—though Bonaparte himself was slightly
wounded in the attack. A week later the army commenced
its march to Cairo.</p>

<p>Bonaparte issued one of his bombastic and mendacious
proclamations to the Egyptian people, explaining that he
was making war against the Mamelukes, and not against
them or the Sultan.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For a long time [it said] the crowd of slaves bought in Georgia and the
Caucasus have tyrannized the most beautiful place in the world; but God,
on whom all depends, has ordained that their empire is finished. People
of Egypt, they have told you that I have come to destroy your religion.
Do not believe them. Answer that I am come to restore your rights, to
punish the usurpers, and that I respect more than the Mamelukes, God,
his Prophet, and the Koran.... Thrice happy are those who will be on
our side. They will prosper in their fortune and their rank.... But
woe threefold to those who arm themselves for the Mamelukes and fight
against us.... Each man will thank God for the destruction of the
Mamelukes and will cry “Glory to the Sultan! Glory to the French
army, his friend! Malediction to the Mamelukes and good luck to the
people of Egypt.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The army suffered greatly on its march to Cairo from
the heat and the sand. The soldiers murmured and asked
for what purpose they were brought to such a country,
where they saw no evidence of wealth, and where there was
nothing to loot. But they fought two battles on the way
against the Mamelukes and easily defeated them. The armies
against them on both occasions consisted of no more than
twelve thousand men, of whom only five thousand were
Mamelukes and the others ill-trained fellaheen. These were
of no avail against thirty thousand veterans of the French.
The city of Cairo, on the approach of Bonaparte, was sacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
by the retreating Egyptians. He presented himself rather
as the saviour of life and property. He had no difficulty
in restoring order there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nelson, on the arrival of his fleet at Naples,
heard definite accounts of the destination of the French
armada. He retraced his course to Egypt. On the
memorable 1st of August, 1798, he came in sight of the
enemy’s fleet, anchored in Aboukir Bay. The oft-told story
of the decisive and glorious battle need not be repeated.
The French fleet, under Admiral Brueys, was annihilated
by the British fleet, much inferior in number of men and
guns. The admiral was killed. His flagship was blown
up. Only two of his ships escaped for a time, and later
were captured before reaching France. As a result, the
communications of the French army with France were
thenceforth completely severed. It was hopelessly stranded
in Egypt. Bonaparte did not hear of the disaster till
August 19th, on his return from an expedition, in which
he defeated and chased from the country a force of Mamelukes,
under Ibrahim Pasha. His sole remark was: “Eh
bien! It will be necessary to remain in these countries
or to make a grand exit like the ancients. The English
will compel us to do greater things than we intended.”</p>

<p>The signal victory of the British fleet had far-reaching
results. The Sultan of Turkey, who had hitherto been
undecided as to his policy, now felt that he might safely
take up arms against the French and reassert his sovereignty
in Egypt. He well knew that Bonaparte could receive
no reinforcements from France and that the invading army
must gradually melt away. He declared war against France,
and entered into alliances, offensive and defensive, with
Russia and England. His alliance with the former led to
strange results. A combined fleet of Russia and Turkey,
hitherto the most deadly foes to one another, issued from
the Dardanelles, and attacked and drove the French from
the Ionian Islands, so recently acquired by them, and
from their fortresses on the mainland.</p>

<p>The Porte also collected two armies for the reconquest
of Egypt, the one in Syria, the other in the island of
Rhodes. Bonaparte decided to anticipate attack by the
invasion of Syria. He spent at Cairo the winter of 1798-9,
the least reputable period of his amazing career. His
private life there was most scandalous, far more so than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
that, bad enough, of his wife, Josephine, whom he had
left at Paris. His public life was little better. In the
hopes of conciliating the Egyptian people and facilitating
the further conquests in the East, of which he dreamt, he
professed unbounded admiration for the Moslem religion.
He feigned to be a convert to that faith. His vaunting
proclamations were headed: “In the name of Allah. There
is no God but God. He has no son and reigns without
a partner.” He did his best to induce his soldiers to
become Moslems, but in vain. No one was taken in by
these fooleries. He gained no respect from Egyptians of
any creed. There were many outbreaks in different parts
of the country, and a most serious one in Cairo. They
were put down with ruthless severity. He followed the
Turkish practice of decapitating the prisoners and great
numbers of suspects, and exhibiting their bleeding heads
in public places as a warning to others.</p>

<p>Bonaparte left Egypt in January, 1799, with an army
of twenty-five thousand, made up in part by sailors of
his sunken fleet, and in part by recruits from the Mamelukes.
He crossed the Isthmus of Suez, and reached Gaza
on February 25th and Jaffa on March 7th. This last
city was held by five thousand Turks. After a brave
defence they capitulated on terms that they should be
treated as prisoners of war. In disregard of this they
were marched down to the beach and, by order of
Bonaparte, were slaughtered in cold blood because it was
inconvenient to encumber his army with prisoners. No
worse deed of Turkish atrocity has been recorded in these
pages. Leaving Jaffa, his army arrived before Acre in
a few days. “When I have captured Acre,” he said to
his generals, “I shall arm the tribes. I shall be in a
position to threaten Constantinople. I shall turn the British
Empire upside down.”</p>

<p>But he reached at Acre the end of his tether in the
East. He had sent his heavy guns by sea to meet him
there. They were captured on the way by the British
fleet, and were now mounted on the mud ramparts
of the fortress and used against him. A British fleet,
under command of Sir Sidney Smith, was lying in the
roadstead and kept the communications open with Constantinople.
The admiral and his sailors assisted in the
defence of the city, the garrison of which consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
only three thousand men. Its weak fortifications had been
strengthened by Colonel Philippeaux, a distinguished French
royalist. Against these defences Bonaparte hurled his army
in vain. In the sixty days of siege there were forty
assaults and twenty sorties of the garrison. “In that
miserable fort,” said Bonaparte, “lay the fate of the East.”</p>

<p>On May 7th large reinforcements arrived from the
Turkish army at Rhodes. A last and desperate assault,
led by General Kléber, was unsuccessful. Bonaparte was
compelled to admit his failure. His dream of an Eastern
Empire was dissipated for ever. On May 20th he commenced
a retreat, after a loss by death of four thousand
men and eight generals. The army suffered most severely
in passing through the desert.</p>

<p>Shortly after the return of the French troops to Egypt
on July 14th, an army of fifteen thousand Turks, convoyed
by the British fleet, was landed at Aboukir.
Bonaparte attacked on the 25th and utterly defeated it.
Thousands of the Turks were driven into the sea and
drowned. This victory of the veterans of the French army
over the ill-trained Turkish levies, without guns or cavalry,
was a godsend to Bonaparte. It shed a gleam of glory over
the terrible failure of the whole expedition. His dispatches
made the most of it. At this stage news from France
showed the necessity for his return there. He decided to
abandon the army to its fate. With the utmost secrecy
arrangements were made for the embarkation of the
general and his staff on board two frigates. They rode
down to the shore and got into boats, leaving their horses
behind them. The return of the riderless horses was the
first intimation to those left behind that they were abandoned
by their general. The two frigates left Egypt on
August 22nd and, by hugging the African coast, they
escaped the British cruisers, and after a most hazardous
voyage of six weeks they landed their passengers in France,
where Bonaparte posed as a conqueror. Nor did his failure
in Egypt interfere with his subsequent triumphant career.</p>

<p>Early in March 1801 a British army of fifteen thousand
men, under Sir Ralph Abercromby, landed in Egypt, and
later another contingent, under General Baird, coming from
India, also arrived there. The French army of occupation
was badly handled. It was divided between Cairo
and Alexandria. It was defeated in detail and ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
surrendered. It was then said to number twenty-four
thousand men and three hundred and twelve guns. On
hearing of this disaster Bonaparte is said to have felt
great anguish. “We have lost Egypt,” he said. “My
projects have been destroyed by the British.” Egypt was
restored to the Sultan, freed not only from the French but
also from the Mamelukes, and for a time Turkish pashas,
appointed by the Porte, ruled the country. There can be
no doubt that the Sultan owed this wholly and solely to
the British Government. It will be seen that he showed
little gratitude, for in a very few years’ time he took the part
of the French in the great war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1802, a peace was patched up for a time
between England and France at Amiens. Concurrently
with this terms of peace were agreed upon between France
and the Porte, under which the sovereignty of the Sultan
over Egypt was recognized. When, two years later, war
again broke out between France and England and other
Powers, Bonaparte, then First Consul, reversed his action
as regards the Ottoman Empire, and made an alliance
with it a cardinal point of his new policy.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of peace with France in 1802,
Sultan Selim had a respite for a very few years before
he was again involved in war. He directed his attention
to serious internal reforms of his Empire. He fully recognized
that the first and foremost of these must be the
reorganization, if not the suppression, of the corps of
Janissaries. Not only had the experience of late wars
shown that they had become a most incompetent military
force, quite unable to meet on equal terms the well-trained
soldiers of Russia and France, but in every part of his
Empire they were a danger to the State, endeavouring to
monopolize power and to oust that of the pashas appointed
by himself. They were also the main oppressors of the
rayas. The task of suppressing them and of creating
an army on the model of those of European Powers was
a most difficult and dangerous one, for the Janissaries
were, or pretended to be, the most devout of Moslems,
and were supported by the fanatical part of the population.
They had strong supporters in the Divan. The
ulemas were almost unanimously in their favour. The
Divan was divided into two parties, those who favoured
reform and who gave support to the Sultan, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
reactionary party, who were opposed to all reform and
championed the Janissaries. There was another serious
division of the Divan—namely those who espoused the cause
of Russia, not infrequently in the pay of that Power, and
those who favoured France. After the conclusion of peace,
France was represented at the Court of the Sultan by very
able ministers, who soon regained the influence for that
country which it had formerly enjoyed.</p>

<p>Nowhere throughout the Empire were the Janissaries
more turbulent and dangerous or more oppressive to the
rayas than in Serbia. They aimed at governing the
province in the same way as the Mamelukes in Egypt
and the military Begs in Algiers and Tunis, and if they
had been allowed to have their way, Serbia would have
achieved a virtual independence of the Porte, under a
military and fanatical Moslem despotism. The Janissaries
there were almost as hostile to the Spahis inhabiting the
provinces as to the rayas. They aimed at ousting the
Spahis from their feudal rights in the country districts
and at an assumption of ownership of land, more oppressive
to the peasant Christian cultivators of the soil than
that of the Spahis. Both Spahis and rayas appealed
to the Porte for protection against these ruffians. The
rayas in their petition to the Sultan said that—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>not only were they reduced to abject poverty by the Dahis (the leaders
of the Janissaries), but they were attacked in their religion, their morality,
and their honour. No husband was secure as to his wife, no father as
to his daughter, no brother as to his sister. The Church, the cloister, the
monks, the priests, all were violated. Art thou still our Czar? then come
and free us from these evildoers, and if thou wilt not save us, at least tell
us that we may decide whether to flee to the mountains and forests, or to
seek in the rivers a termination of our miserable existence.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Sultan was willing to listen to these grave complaints,
and to put down the turbulent Dahis and their
attendant Janissaries, not so much out of sympathy for
the rayas as in order to restore his own authority in
the province and as a first step towards the reformation or
suppression of the Janissaries elsewhere throughout his
Empire. He began by threatening the Dahis. If they
did not mend their ways, he would send an army against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>them. These ruffians, knowing that the Sultan could not
venture to employ a Moslem force against them, came to
the conclusion that he meant to arm the rayas of the
province. They determined to anticipate this by a general
massacre. If no resistance had been offered to this, the
whole Christian population of Serbia would have been
exterminated. The rayas, however, were no longer the
submissive and patient people they had been reduced to
by servitude for two hundred and fifty years under the
Turks, during which no one of them had been allowed
to carry about him a weapon of defence. As has been
already stated, they had been invited to rebel by the
Austrians in their last war with the Turks, had been armed
by them, and had given valuable assistance. Great
numbers of them had been trained as soldiers, and retained
their arms when the Austrians retired from the country,
after the peace of Sistova, which provided no adequate
security for these unfortunate people.</p>

<p>They now, in 1807, rose in arms against their
oppressors, who were bent on exterminating them. They
elected as their leader George Petrowitsch (Kara George,
as he is known in history), a peasant like themselves, a
most brave man, who had served in the Austrian army,
and who soon showed great qualities as a general. Under
his leadership the rayas succeeded in driving the Dahis
and Janissaries out of the country districts.</p>

<p>The Sultan at the commencement of this servile war
lent his assistance to the rayas. The Pasha of Bosnia
was instructed to support them with an armed force. The
local Spahis also, who were still in the country and had
not been driven away by the Dahis, lent assistance. On
the other hand, the Dahis received assistance from the
fanatical part of the Moslems in the towns. They had
also the sympathy and aid of Passhwan Oghlou, the mutinous
Pasha of Widdin. It was, however, almost wholly due to
the efforts of the Serbian rayas that the Dahis were completely
defeated. Most of them were slaughtered, and the
world was well rid of them. When this was achieved,
the whole of Serbia was practically in the hands of the
Christian rayas, with the exception of Belgrade and a few
fortresses, which were garrisoned by the Sultan’s troops.</p>

<p>At this stage the Sultan, when all that he really aimed
at was achieved—namely the suppression of the local Janis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>saries—summoned
the insurgent rayas to lay down their
arms and to resume their position as subjects of the Porte
and as rayas under the yoke of the local Spahis as of
yore. The war, however, had evoked a national spirit
among the Christian population, which would not be content
with the old condition of servitude. They sent a
petition to the Russian Government claiming assistance on
the ground that they were members of the Greek Church.
The Czar, in reply, advised them to present their claims
at Constantinople, and promised to give his support to
them at the Porte. They then sent a deputation to the
Sultan, and boldly claimed that Belgrade and the other
fortresses should be given up to them, and asked that
arrears of taxes and tribute should be remitted. The first
of these was the most important, for it virtually meant
a claim for autonomy under the suzerainty only of the
Sultan.</p>

<p>These demands caused the greatest indignation among
the Moslems of the capital, and the Sultan forthwith rejected
them. He ordered the members of the deputation
to be imprisoned. He directed the Pasha of Nisch to
invade Serbia and reduce the contumacious rayas to their
former condition. He threatened them with death or
slavery. Kara George met this force on the frontier of
Serbia and defeated it. He also defeated two other armies
which the Sultan sent against him, and he was able, unaided
by any external force, to capture Belgrade and the
other fortresses and expel the Turkish garrisons. Thus it
happened that the native Christians of Serbia, by their
own heroic efforts, without any foreign assistance, achieved
a virtual independence of Ottoman rule, an event of supreme
importance in its effect on other Christian communities
under servitude to the Turks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile important events were developing at Constantinople.
It was the scene of a violent diplomatic
struggle between Russia and England on the one hand,
and France on the other, for the support of the Porte in
the war then raging in Europe. The Emperor Napoleon
sent as ambassador there General Sebastiani, formerly a
priest, now a soldier and able diplomat. His demands
were supported by the great victory of the French over
the Austrians at Ulm. The recent acquisition by France
of Dalmatia and a part of Croatia brought that Power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
into close relation with Turkey. Sebastiani pressed for
the support of Turkey with great insistence.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Russia was equally cogent in its
demands, and even more threatening. It insisted on an
alliance, offensive and defensive. It demanded that the
Sultan should recognize the Czar as the protector of all
the Christians in Turkey professing the Greek religion,
and that the Russian Ambassador should have the right
of intervention on their behalf. The Sultan, conscious of
the inferiority of his military force, could only temporize.</p>

<p>Moslem pride and fanaticism was greatly excited by
the demands of Russia. Sebastiani, working on this,
persuaded the Sultan, by way of retort to Russia, to depose
the Hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia, on the ground
that they were suspected of being pensioners of Russia.
The Czar treated this as a gross breach of the engagement
entered into by the Porte, in 1802, under which the
Hospodars of the two principalities were only to be removed
from their posts with the consent of Russia. He thereupon
ordered an army of thirty-five thousand men, under
General Michelsen, to invade Moldavia. The army entered
Jassy and, a little later, Bucharest before the Porte was
able to make any resistance.</p>

<p>The British Government at the same time gave full
support to Russia. Its Ambassador, Mr. Arbuthnot, insisted
on the Porte joining the alliance of England and
Russia against France. The Sultan refused to do so. Mr.
Arbuthnot thereupon sailed away in a frigate and joined
the British fleet lying off the island of Tenedos, under the
command of Admiral Duckworth, which consisted of seven
battleships and two frigates. This fleet, favoured by a
fair wind, then forced the Dardanelles against the Turkish
batteries on February 19, 1807, with little damage, and
made its appearance in the Sea of Marmora. It there
destroyed a Turkish battleship and four corvettes.</p>

<p>The fleet anchored off the Prince’s Islands, within a few
miles of Constantinople, which was exposed to bombardment
from the sea. The admiral presented a demand to
the Porte for the surrender of the Ottoman fleet lying at
Constantinople and for compliance with the demands of Mr.
Arbuthnot. He threatened to bombard the city if his
ultimatum was rejected. If any serious effect could have
been given to this menace, immediate action should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
been taken. The Ambassador and the admiral allowed
themselves to be drawn into a negotiation spread over ten
days, during which the Sultan and the whole male population
of his capital were engaged, with feverish haste, in
strengthening the defences of the city. A thousand guns
and a hundred mortars were mounted on its batteries.
The Turkish fleet, consisting of twelve battleships, was
removed to a point in the harbour beyond the reach of
the guns of a bombarding fleet. The defences of the
Dardanelles were also greatly strengthened. Admiral Duckworth
was compelled at last to the conclusion that a
bombardment would be attended with very serious risk
to his own fleet. If it were damaged, the Turkish fleet,
coming out of the Bosphorus, might assail it with advantage.
It might also be impossible for it to repass the Dardanelles.
He decided to withdraw. On March 1st he weighed anchor,
and on the 3rd he repassed the Dardanelles, this time with
considerable damage to his ships and loss of life. Some
of the ships were struck by the enormous stone balls fired
from the Turkish batteries. Two corvettes were sunk and
six hundred men were killed. The fleet narrowly escaped
destruction. The whole adventure redounded little to the
credit either of the diplomacy or strategy of the British
Government.</p>

<p>Not content with this futile demonstration against Constantinople,
the British Government attempted another
expedition, even more futile and senseless, this time against
Egypt, in the hope, it may be supposed, of bringing
pressure to bear on the Sultan. A force of five thousand
soldiers was sent from Sicily, then in British occupation,
and was landed on the Egyptian coast near Alexandria
on March 18th. It marched on that city, which, garrisoned
by only four hundred and fifty Turks, surrendered. This
was its first and last success. A few days later fifteen
hundred men were sent to attack Rosetta, at the mouth of
the Nile, and were repulsed. Another expedition was even
more unsuccessful. Of two thousand men sent out, one
thousand were killed and wounded. There seems to have
been expectation that the Mamelukes would assist the British
against the Turkish troops. This was not realized. The
remains of the small army under General Fraser were
cooped up in Alexandria until September, when, owing
to the serious disaffection of the inhabitants of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
and the approach of a large body of Turks from Cairo,
it was recognized that its position was untenable. A flag
of truce was sent to the advancing Turks with the offer
to evacuate Egypt if the British prisoners in their hands
were given up to them. This was accepted, and on
September 25th the little army embarked again on its
transports and returned to Sicily.</p>

<p>These two senseless expeditions had an effect the very
reverse of which was intended. They exasperated Turkish
opinion and drove the Porte into closer alliance with the
French. In the meantime, and since the failure of the
demonstration by Duckworth’s fleet, momentous events
occurred in Constantinople. The Sultan took advantage
of the departure of the main body of Janissaries with the
army sent to the Danube to extend his scheme for raising
a military force, clothed and drilled and paid on the
European system. He issued an edict that the youngest
and best of the Janissaries were to be enrolled in this new
corps. This caused the gravest discontent among the
Janissaries still in garrison at Constantinople, to the reactionary
party in the Divan, and to the ulemas. The
Janissaries broke out in mutiny at the end of May 1807.
They put this question to the Mufti: “What punishment
is deserved by one who has established the new military
force?” The Mufti replied: “Death, and that according to
the Koran, since the Divan had introduced among Mussulmans
the manners of infidels and manifested an intention
to suppress the Janissaries, who were the true defenders
of the law and the prophets.”</p>

<p>Fortified by this <i>fetva</i>, the Janissaries then passed a
resolution that Selim must be deposed. They sent a deputation
to the Sultan to insist on his abdication. Selim,
however, had already heard of their intention. He had
no force at hand sufficient to overcome the mutinous
Janissaries. He anticipated their demands by himself going
to the Cage, where his cousin Mustapha, the next heir
to the throne, was immured, making obeisance to him as
Sultan, advising him not to listen to those who desired
great changes, and wishing him a happier reign than his
own. He then attempted to commit suicide by taking
poison, but Mustapha dashed the cup containing it from
his hands and swore that his life should be saved. On
the arrival of the deputation of Janissaries at the palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
they found that a new Sultan was already installed there.
Selim retired with dignity to the apartments in the Cage
vacated by Mustapha.</p>

<p>The new Sultan, Mustapha III, was a very weak and
incompetent man. He was aged thirty, of imperfect education
and poor intellect. He filled the throne for a few
months only, during which there was practically no government.
Though Selim himself was reconciled to the loss
of his throne, he had powerful friends who resented his
fall. Bairactar, the Pasha of Rustchuck, who owed his
post to Selim, marched upon Constantinople with forty
thousand Bosnians and Albanians. They overawed the
Janissaries and invaded the palace. They knocked at its
gates and demanded that Selim should be brought out to
them. Mustapha, however, on their approach, had already
given orders that Selim and Mahmoud, the only survivors
of the Othman race besides himself, were to be put to
death, in the hope that this might save his own life. The
mutes were able to strangle Selim, not without a desperate
struggle, which, if prolonged for a few minutes, would
have saved him, for Bairactar was already storming at
the gate of the palace. Mahmoud could not be found.
Selim’s body was then cast out to Bairactar and his men.
“Here is he you seek!” it was called out. On entering
the palace Bairactar found Mustapha seated on his throne.
He was dragged from it and was sent to prison. Mahmoud,
who had been hidden in the furnace of a bath, was found
and was installed as Sultan.</p>

<p>Bairactar, having succeeded in deposing Mustapha and
installing Mahmoud, most unwisely allowed the Bosnian
and Albanian troops to return to their homes. There
remained only four thousand men as a bodyguard on whom
the new Sultan could rely. They were not sufficient to withstand
the Janissaries. These turbulent men broke out in
another rebellion. They attacked Bairactar in his palace.
He took refuge in a tower used as a powder magazine.
He was there blown up, whether by accident or wilfully
is not known. There ensued a few days of civil war.
The artillery on whom the Sultan relied went over to the
Janissaries. A counter-revolution was effected. Mustapha
would have been restored to the throne if he had not
been put to death in the interval. Mahmoud owed his
life to the fact that he was the last surviving male of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
the Othman race. He was compelled to yield to the
menaces of the Janissaries, who were now masters of the
city. An edict was issued in his name which repealed all
the reforms effected by Selim. The old system was
restored, with all its abuses. In the next three or four
years the Janissaries were virtually the rulers of the Empire.
Grand Viziers were appointed and dismissed at their dictation.
Mahmoud was greatly humiliated. But he bided
his time, and it will be seen that before long he inflicted
a most bloody revenge on the Janissaries and extinguished
their corps for ever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile affairs on the Danube fared badly with the
Turks, as might be expected. The Russians gained complete
possession of Moldavia and Wallachia. Their armies
crossed the Danube and laid siege to fortresses on the
right bank. In 1807 Russia and France came to terms.
The treaty of Tilsit provided that hostilities were to cease
between Russia and Turkey, and that the Russian troops
were to be withdrawn from Moldavia and Wallachia, till
a definitive agreement had been come to between these two
Powers. But a secret article, which was not made public
till some time later, provided that all the European provinces
of Turkey, except Roumelia and Constantinople, were to
be taken from the Sultan. We now know that there were
long discussions between Napoleon and the Czar, on the
River Niemen, as to the future disposal of these and
other provinces. Napoleon was ready to concede to Russia
the Danubian principalities and Bulgaria. He claimed for
France Egypt, Syria, Greece, all the islands of the Archipelago,
and Crete. Austria was to be propitiated by the
cession of Bosnia and Serbia. The question remained what
was to be done with Constantinople. Napoleon would not
concede it to Russia. The Czar insisted upon this. The
agreement broke down on this point. But it is certain
that Napoleon was willing enough to throw over his recent
allies, the Turks, and to join with their hereditary foe in
dismembering their Empire. A more perfidious transaction
is not to be found in history.</p>

<p>In compliance with the treaty of Tilsit, Russia suspended
hostilities with the Porte. But the Russian army remained
in occupation of Wallachia and Moldavia, and showed no
intention to evacuate them. War was renewed in 1809.
Prince Bagration, at the head of a Russian army, crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the Danube and captured several Turkish fortresses on its
right bank. In the following year, 1810, the Russians
captured the important stronghold Silistria, but failed with
very heavy loss in an assault on Rustchuck. Later in the
year they inflicted a severe defeat on the army of the
Grand Vizier at Baltin. They then succeeded in a second
attack on Rustchuck, and captured Sistova. But they failed
to take the fortified camp at Schumla, and were unable
therefore to cross the Balkan range.</p>

<p>In 1811 war was again imminent between Russia and
France, and the Russian generals on the Danube received
orders to stand on the defensive. The Turks took
advantage of this, and sent a large army across the Danube.
It was eventually defeated and compelled to surrender.
In spite of their successes, the Russians were willing to
come to terms. They had hitherto insisted on the retention
of Wallachia and Moldavia. They were now ready to
make concessions. The invasion of Russia by Napoleon
was imminent. It was necessary for the Czar to concentrate
all his forces in defence of his own Empire.
Negotiations were commenced in 1811, and they resulted
in the treaty of Bucharest of May 28, 1812. It was
agreed that the River Pruth was to be the new boundary
between the two Empires. The whole of Wallachia and
a great part of Moldavia were restored to Turkey. Bessarabia
and a part of Moldavia were ceded to Russia.</p>

<p>The treatment of Serbia in the treaty was ungenerous
on the part of Russia. An amnesty was to be granted to
its people. They were to be secured in future the regulation
of their internal affairs. But the supremacy of the Sultan
was to be maintained, and Belgrade and other fortresses
which had been captured by the Serbians were again to
be garrisoned by Turkish troops. This last was the cause
of great troubles in the future. But for the impending
invasion of Russia by Napoleon the terms would undoubtedly
have been far less favourable to the Porte.</p>

MAHMOUD II<br />

<small>1808-39</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first four years of Mahmoud’s long reign of thirty-one
years were fraught with bitter humiliation to him at
the hands of the Janissaries. There was no indication of
his subsequent career, when he proved himself to be the
most able and resolute of Sultans since Solyman the Magnificent.
But he was also the most unfortunate, for he was
unable to prevent a greater reduction of the Turkish Empire
than had been incurred by any one of the long line of
degenerate Sultans. It may well be, however, that but for
his action still greater losses would have resulted, for on his
advent to the throne the Empire seemed to be on the brink
of ruin. In every part of it turbulent and rebellious pashas
were asserting independence. In Epirus the celebrated Ali
Pasha of Janina had cast off allegiance, and was threatening
to extend his rule over Greece, Thessaly, and the Ionian
Islands. At Widdin on the Danube, at Bagdad on the
Tigris, at Acre in Syria, the same process was being pursued
by other pashas. In Egypt, Mehemet Ali had assumed
the position of Governor and was creating an army and a
navy independent of the Porte. In Arabia, the sect of
Wahabees had attained a virtual independence, and had
obtained possession of the holy cities. Other provinces,
such as Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Greece, were
seething with disaffection caused by long and intolerable
misgovernment. The difficulty of holding together the
distracted Empire was greatly increased by the want of an
effective army under the full control of the central Government,
so as to enable it to cope with the centrifugal forces
which threatened disruption. The Janissaries, who had
contributed so largely to the growth of the Empire, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
now a standing danger to it. They were able to overawe
the Sultan, and to dictate to him the appointment and dismissal
of Viziers. But successive campaigns on the Danube,
and conflicts with rebellious pashas, had given abundant
proof of their inefficiency as a military force. Compared
with the armies of European Powers they were an ill-disciplined
and badly armed mob. They arrogantly refused
to be armed, clothed, and drilled after the fashion of
European armies. While useless for war, they were formidable
for other purposes. They were under no control.
They terrorized the capital, and in the provinces they were
at the disposal of any adventurous pasha who suborned
them to support his ambitious and rebellious projects.
Mahmoud from the earliest years of his reign fully recognized,
as many of his predecessors had done, how urgent
the necessity was to put an end to this turbulent force,
and to create a new army which would obey and support
him as Sultan, and be of value against external enemies.
It is his principal claim in the history of Turkey that he
was able to effect this. Eighteen years, however, elapsed
before he felt strong enough to grapple with these foes of
his dynasty and State.</p>

<p>Apart from this great achievement, he showed inflexible
firmness and courage in the great difficulties which confronted
him, and almost alone he bore the burden of the
State for thirty-one years of unparalleled peril, and often
of most serious disaster. It will be seen that, in spite of
these high qualities, and in spite of the reform of his army,
the losses of territory to his Empire were very serious. In
Greece, the Morea, and the provinces north of the Gulf of
Corinth up to the frontier of Thessaly, acquired complete
independence under the guarantee of the three Great Powers
of Europe. Egypt, Moldavia and Wallachia, and Serbia
attained almost similar independence, subject only to
the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan of Turkey and the
payment of fixed tributes. They no longer added to the real
strength of the Empire. On the other hand, he completely
destroyed the power of the rebellious Pashas of Janina,
Widdin, Bagdad, and Acre, and through Mehemet Ali, the
Pasha of Egypt, he subdued the Wahabees and recovered
the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.</p>

<p>It should be added that Mahmoud, unlike so many of
his predecessors, devoted his life to affairs of his State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
rather than to his harem. He committed at times acts of
great cruelty. He put to death his brother Mustapha and
Mustapha’s only son, and caused to be drowned in the
Bosphorus four ladies of Mustapha’s harem who were
enceinte. He had no scruple in directing the secret
assassination of any persons whom he suspected of harbouring
schemes in opposition to his own. He authorized
the perpetration of ruthless massacres of Greeks in all parts
of his Empire at the inception of the revolution in Greece.
But these were acts of policy in accord with the traditions
of his family, approved by public opinion of the Turks, by
whom terrorism and massacre were recognized as justifiable
methods of government. The murder of his relatives left
him the sole survivor of the Othman race, a position which
secured him from intrigues against his throne by the
Janissaries.</p>

<p>The most serious of the losses to the Empire in
Mahmoud’s reign was that of Egypt, for it was a Moslem
country, and though for many years previously the hold
on it by the Ottoman Porte had been slender, and the
Mamelukes had been able, as a rule, to impose their will
and to govern the province, yet the Porte could in the main
rely on it for support to the Empire in times of emergency.
It will be well, therefore, to explain the changes effected
in Egypt, for it will be seen that they had a great bearing
on events in other parts of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Mehemet Ali, who effected the virtual independence of
Egypt, subject to the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan,
was the most remarkable man that the Mahommedan world
had produced in modern times. The son of an Albanian
Moslem fisherman and small landowner at Kavala, on the
borders of Thrace and Macedonia, he was left a penniless
orphan, and was brought up as a dependent in the household
of the chief magistrate of the district, who was a
distant relative. He never learnt to read or write. He
said of himself in later years that the only books he ever
read were men’s faces, and that he seldom made a mistake
in them. When the French invaded Egypt under General
Bonaparte, Mehemet Ali was sent in defence of it with a
band of three hundred Albanians, as one of their junior
officers, and before long, on the return home of the commanding
officer, contrived to step into his place. When
the Turkish army was driven into the sea at Aboukir in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
1794 by Napoleon, he was saved from drowning by a
boat from the British admiral’s ship. Later he was put
in command of all the Albanians employed in Egypt, and
was attached for a time to the British army.</p>

<p>After the departure of the British from Egypt, conflict
arose between the Turks and the Mamelukes for the control
of the government. Mehemet at first sided with the Mamelukes,
but later he threw them over in favour of the
Albanians in the service of the Turks. When the British
Government sent its futile expedition to Egypt in 1808,
Mehemet was chiefly concerned in opposing it. He was
in command at Rosetta when a great number of British
soldiers were slain, and a few days later he entered Cairo in
triumph through an avenue of British heads stuck on pikes.
Thenceforth he rapidly rose in influence and position, and
at the age of thirty-five was the most powerful man in
Egypt, and was able to instal himself as Pasha. He was
harassed and opposed by the Mamelukes. He determined
to get rid of them. He invited about five hundred of their
leading men to a friendly conference at the citadel of Cairo.
After entertaining them at a sumptuous repast, he ordered
the gates to be shut, and had them all shot down in
the narrow street of the citadel. A single man only of
them survived by leaping his horse from the wall of the
citadel, a height of 30 feet. This was followed by a
slaughter of nearly all the Mamelukes in the country.
Mehemet in this set the example which was followed a
few years later by Sultan Mahmoud in suppressing the
Janissaries.</p>

<p>Thenceforward Mehemet was undisputed ruler of Egypt.
He had a genius for organization and government.
Though cruel and vindictive, and even bloodthirsty, as
regards his enemies and against evildoers of all kinds,
he had a keen sense of justice, and a determination to
mete it out equally, and without favour, to the people of
all sects and races. He brought about peace and order
and prosperity such as Egypt had never of late years
enjoyed. He was ambitious to extend his rule. He
organized for this purpose, and for asserting himself against
the Porte, an army of a hundred thousand men raised by
conscription and armed and drilled on the model of
European armies, with the aid of French and Italian officers
who had served under Napoleon. He also built a power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>ful
fleet with the help of French naval constructors. He
soon proved the value of his new army by putting down
a revolt in Arabia of the Wahabees. He did this, on
behalf of, and in the name of the Sultan. He also conquered
the oasis of Senaar and extended the rule of
Egypt into the Sudan. It will be seen that later, in
1825 and 1826, he sent his army and navy in support of
the Sultan to the Morea for the purpose of putting an
end to the revolution in Greece, which the Sultan had been
unable to cope with. Before dealing with this, however, it
will be well to revert to Mahmoud and explain the course
of events which compelled him to call in aid Mehemet
Ali’s army.</p>

<p>One of the earliest matters which Mahmoud had to deal
with was that of Serbia. The treaty of Bucharest had left
that province in a very unsettled and ambiguous position.
The Turks, under its terms, were permitted to garrison
Belgrade and other fortresses, and were to concede to
the Serbians self-government, but there was no adequate
guarantee for this. The Serbians, who were in possession
of the fortresses, refused to give them up to the Turks
until a scheme of self-government was arranged. The
Porte insisted on immediate surrender. Subsequent proceedings
showed that there was no intention to give effective
self-government to the Serbians. The Sultan in 1813 sent
an army to enforce his claims. Kara George, in most
strange contrast to his previous heroic action, lost courage
on this occasion. After burying the treasure which he had
amassed as virtual ruler of Serbia, he fled the country and
sought refuge with the Austrians. In so doing he passed
out of the history of his country, save that when, some years
later, he thought he might safely return to Serbia, he was
arrested and shot as a traitor.</p>

<p>After this defection Serbia seemed to be at the mercy
of the Turks, and the greater part of it was occupied
by them. But at the moment of its great peril another
national patriot and hero rose to the front in the person of
Milosch Obrenowitch, who, much as Kara George had done
a few years previously, took the lead in rousing the Christian
population to resistance, and in leading them to victory. He
succeeded in driving the Turks from all the country districts
and shutting them up in the fortresses. Mahmoud then
sent another army with the object of relieving the Turks in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the Serbian fortresses and subduing the rebels. The army,
however, halted on the frontier, and negotiations ensued
which lasted for some years without any result. The
Sultan, it seems, was unwilling, in view of the numerous
other difficulties pending in his Empire, to risk the
loss of an army in a guerrilla war in the mountains of
Serbia.</p>

<p>The most serious of Mahmoud’s other difficulties at this
period was the insurrection of the Greeks in 1821. Never
was rebellion of a subject race more justifiable. Nowhere
throughout the Ottoman Empire were the results of its
rule more degrading and intolerable than in Greece. It
served none of the purposes for which governments exist.
Life and property and honour were without security, and
justice had degenerated into the practice of selling injustice
to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>The condition of the Greek population was infinitely
worse than that of their compatriots in most other parts of
the Empire. In Constantinople the Greeks were a wealthy
community. They had a large share in the administration
of the Empire. The Porte, in fact, could not do without
them. Their religion was under the special protection
accorded to it by Mahomet the Conqueror. The trade of
the Empire was largely in their hands. At Smyrna,
Salonika, and many other cities, there were large numbers
of Greeks who had enjoyed facilities of trade and had
accumulated wealth. Mahmoud, like many of his predecessors,
recognized that, by largely contributing to taxes,
these people were a source of wealth to his Government,
and was not disposed to adopt any measure proposed by
the more fanatical of Moslems to extirpate them or to drive
them into rebellion. Not a few of the islands of the
archipelago, such as Scios and Psara, were practically
allowed to govern themselves, and life there was as well-ordered
as in any part of Europe.</p>

<p>It was very different with Greece on the mainland. It
seems to have been the policy of the Porte to prevent its
becoming a populous and wealthy country, with a view to
keeping it under close subjection. Much of its land was
in the ownership of Moslems, a majority of whom were
Greeks by race, who had adopted Islam in order to save
their property. They were a fanatical class who were quite
as oppressive to the rayas, the cultivators of the soil, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
were those of pure Turkish descent. The Ottoman Government
presented itself to the Greeks only as an engine
to extract taxes, and the pashas who were sent to
govern them thought only how best and most quickly to
fill their pockets, knowing that their tenure of office would
be very short. The people there compared their condition
with that of the self-governing communities of Scio and
other islands. Education had spread to some extent in
spite of the neglect of the Government. Wealthy Greeks
from other districts had endowed some schools and colleges.
With education came the study of the past history of Greece
and the ambition to renew its nationality and greatness.
For some time past secret societies such as the Hetairia,
promoted in the first instance by the Greeks of Odessa,
had been spreading their influence in Greece, and had laid
the seeds of revolution.</p>

<p>The insurrection in Greece was not only based on
political and racial ideals, it was also an agrarian war, the
revolt of cultivators of the soil against their feudal
oppressors. This gave to the outbreak in rural districts
its intensely persistent, passionate, and cruel attributes.</p>

<p>The revolution broke out in the Morea at the beginning
of April 1821, and soon spread over the whole of its
country districts. It was estimated that at that time there
were twenty thousand Moslems thinly spread in the country
districts, most of them of Greek race, feudal lords of the
soil and oppressors of the rayas. Nearly the whole of these
Moslems were now brutally murdered, without distinction of
age or sex. The survivors fled into the fortresses, which
were garrisoned by Turks. These fortresses were speedily
invested by the Greeks, and within three months nearly all
of them were compelled to surrender. In most cases capitulations
were agreed to on the terms that lives would be
respected, but in no case were these terms adhered to. The
garrisons and the Turkish inhabitants and the refugees
from the country districts who had gathered there were
brutally murdered.</p>

<p>The first encounter between the Turkish soldiers and the
Greeks that could be called a battle was at Valtetsi, in the
neighbourhood of Tripolitza, the capital of the Morea.
Three thousand Greek peasants there defeated five thousand
Turks, with a loss of four hundred Turks and a hundred
and fifty Greeks. The battle destroyed the prestige of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the Turks. It showed that they were no match for the
insurgent Greek peasants.</p>

<p>As a result of this victory, Navarino and Tripolitza fell
into the hands of the Greek insurgents after short sieges.
In both cases the garrisons capitulated on favourable terms
for themselves and the inhabitants of the towns. In neither
case were the terms observed. All the Moslem troops
and inhabitants were ruthlessly massacred. At Tripolitza
these numbered eight thousand, including women and
children. “Greek historians,” says Finlay in his <i>History
of Greece</i>, “have recoiled from telling of these barbarities,
while they have been loud in denouncing those of the
Turks.”</p>

<p>When news of the massacres in the Morea arrived at
Constantinople the greatest alarm and indignation arose.
Bloody and ruthless reprisals ensued against the Greeks
residing there. The Sultan set the example. He directed
that many of the leading Greeks were to be immediately
executed. The Greek Patriarch was hanged by
his order at the gate of the episcopal residence. The <i>fetva</i>
authorizing this was pinned to his body. There was no
reason to believe that the Patriarch was implicated in the
outbreak in Greece. Four other bishops met the same
fate. Thousands of Greeks of inferior position fell victims
to the fury of the people at the capital and at many other
cities, such as Smyrna and Salonika, and in Cyprus. The
Sultan took no steps to restrain these horrors. Women
and children equally with men were murdered. Their houses
were burnt, their property was pillaged. It was estimated
that the number of Greeks thus massacred was not short of
the number of Moslems slaughtered in Greece at the outbreak
of the revolution. Thenceforth Greeks and Turks
emulated one another in their acts of barbarity. The Turks
had always been bloodthirsty when their passions and fears
were roused, and they now had terrible wrongs to avenge.
The Greeks had been degraded by long oppression, and
were little better than Turks. Both people evidently thought
that the results of their cruelties were proof of the wisdom
of inflicting them. The Greeks, by extirpating the Moslems
in the Morea, cleared the country, once for all, of their
oppressors and effected that separation of the two races
which, it will be seen later, the Great Powers of Europe
thought desirable, though they hoped to attain it by peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>ful
expropriation and indemnity. The Turks claimed that
their severities checked the spread of the revolution, and
compelled one half of the Greek people living within their
midst to submit to Ottoman rule.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the revolution broke out in the
Morea. Within a few months the whole of that country
was cleared of Ottoman troops and of Moslem inhabitants.
The outbreak extended to most of the islands of the archipelago,
where the Greeks predominated, where there was
less admixture of Slav blood than on the mainland, and
where the traditions of a long-past national existence and
of high civilization survived in a stronger form. In
spite of their greater prosperity, due to milder treatment
at the hands of the Turks, they were ardently in favour of
independence. It was in the islands that the majority
of Greek merchant vessels were owned. They numbered
between four and five hundred, and were manned by twelve
thousand Greek sailors. An active war fleet was formed out
of these vessels and sailors. They frequently met and
defeated the Turkish fleet. They made special use of fire
ships, and blew up or burnt many of the Turkish vessels
and caused the greatest alarm to the Turkish sailors.</p>

<p>In the course of the four years 1821-4, the Turks were
generally worsted by the Greek insurgents on land and
sea. Not only the Morea, but the parts of Greece north of
the Gulf of Corinth up to the frontier of Thessaly, including
Athens—then reduced to a squalid, third-rate town—and
the islands of the archipelago, achieved a practical
independence. A national government and a representative
assembly were constituted. The outbreak in Greece roused
the sympathies of great numbers of persons in Western
Europe, especially in England and France. In spite of this,
the Governments of these countries for long held aloof and
discouraged the rebellion, not wishing to see Turkey
weakened as against Russia. Lord Byron was an enthusiast
for the Greeks, and in 1824 landed at Missolonghi and
joined their army. But it cannot be said that he effected
much during the short time he survived there. He was
evidently disillusioned, like so many other Philhellenes who
joined the Greeks, by the discords, intrigues, and corruption
of their leaders. But he never lost faith in their
future. He confidently predicted that the Greek nation
would prove itself worthy of freedom. He gave his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
to the cause. He died of malarial fever within a few
weeks of landing at this unhealthy spot. This did much
to arouse the interest of Europe and to promote its intervention
on behalf of the Greeks.</p>

<p>After four years of futile efforts to stamp out the Greek
revolution, it became clear to Sultan Mahmoud that his
army, as then constituted, was unequal to the task. He
was much impressed by the success of Mehemet Ali in
Egypt in creating an army armed and drilled in the manner
of European armies. In 1824, he called on this great
vassal to aid in the reconquest of Greece by sending his
new army and fleet there. Mehemet consented to do so,
but only on the promise of the Sultan that Syria, Damascus,
and Crete, would be added to his Pashalic. He sent his
fleet to co-operate with that of the Sultan on the coast of
the Morea. It sailed from Alexandria on July 25, 1824,
with an army of ten thousand infantry and a thousand
cavalry, under command of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of
Mehemet Ali. They were landed at Modon and marched
thence to Navarino. That fortress was garrisoned by sixteen
hundred Greeks. The flower of the Greek army of
seven thousand men advanced to relieve the fortress.
Ibrahim with three thousand men attacked and utterly
defeated them. The Greeks fled in wild confusion. This
battle was proof that the best Greek troops were unable
to encounter the well-disciplined Egyptians in a pitched
battle.</p>

<p>After the capture of Navarino, Ibrahim continued his
reconquest of Greece with uniform success. The Greeks
were exhausted by their long struggle against the Turks.
They could offer but a very feeble resistance to this new
and far more effective enemy. In April, 1826, the Egyptian
army captured Missolonghi, causing a loss to the Greeks
of four thousand men. Thence he gradually subdued the
whole of the Morea. Later the cities of Corinth and
Athens fell into the hands of the Turks, and on May 6, 1827,
at a battle at Phalerum, in the neighbourhood of this last
city, Reschid Pasha, in command of an Albanian army,
defeated and dispersed the last army of the Greeks then
in the field. The Greek Government was forced to remove
from the mainland to the island of Poros. The whole of
Greece then fell into anarchy. Though the Greek fleet continued
to make a gallant stand against the combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Turkish and Egyptian fleets, it was not strong enough to
maintain a mastery at sea and to cut off the communication
between Ibrahim’s army and its base in Egypt. It is
certain that if the Great Powers of Europe had not intervened,
Greece would have been completely subdued, and
Turkish rule would have been reinstated there. Ibrahim
threatened to remove the whole Greek population and sell
them into slavery, and to replace them by Egyptians and
Arabs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the success of Ibrahim’s army, armed and
disciplined on the model of European armies, as compared
with the failure in previous campaigns in Greece of the
ill-disciplined and badly armed troops of Turkey, produced
a great impression at Constantinople. Mahmoud now found
that his long-cherished project for the reform of the army
was supported almost unanimously by the Divan and by
the whole of the ulemas. He determined, therefore, to
carry it into effect, and to suppress his mortal foes, the
Janissaries. He had been long engaged in making preparations
for a decisive issue with these turbulent troops.
He had formed a body of fourteen thousand artillerymen,
drilled and armed on the new model, and on whom he could
thoroughly rely for support. His predecessor, Selim, had
enlisted a small body of infantry on the same model. The
Agha of the Janissaries, Hussein Pasha, was devoted to
him, as was also the Mufti. The Sultan thereupon, in May
1826, gave orders to the Janissaries that one-fourth of them
were to be incorporated in the new corps of infantry. The
Janissaries refused. They marched in a body, on June 14th,
to the palace, intent on overawing the Sultan, as they had
so often done in the past. They met their master on this
occasion. The Sultan summoned the artillery to his support.
He unfolded the sacred banner and directed their action.
They pounded the Janissaries with cannon shot in the
streets leading to the palace and drove them back to their
barracks with heavy loss. The guns were then concentrated
on the barracks and set fire to them. No quarter was
given. The Janissaries perished either by gun fire or in
the burning barracks. Four thousand of them were disposed
of in this holocaust. The Sultan ruthlessly followed
up his victory. Many more thousands of the Janissaries
were put to death in Constantinople and in other
cities of the Empire. The force was entirely destroyed. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
very name was erased from official records. Mahmoud had
obtained an overwhelming victory. His new army was
at once increased to forty-five thousand men, exclusive of
his artillery, with the intention of gradually raising it to
two hundred thousand. It was recruited, however, wholly
from the Moslem population. The Christians were excluded
from its ranks as rigidly as under the old régime.
There can be no doubt that if time had been allowed to
Mahmoud to complete the number and efficiency of this
new army, the Ottoman Empire would again have become
a most formidable military Power. The Sultan did much
more to centralize power in himself. He abolished the
military feudal system, which had become a gross abuse.
The beys were everywhere suppressed, or were allowed to
draw their incomes only for the term of their lives. The
rents hitherto paid to these persons were in the future to be
paid directly to the State.</p>

<p>Mahmoud also effected many other important reforms.
He abolished the Court of Confiscations, which had provided
a revenue to the State out of property of persons condemned
to death or exile, and which had become a great
abuse. He deprived pashas of their power to put people
to death at their will without trial. He enacted that no
one should in future be so dealt with without formal trial
and the right of appeal. He put the vast Vacouf property
(dedicated to Islam) under State management. He
prohibited the wearing of turbans and made the use of the
fez universal in his Empire. He set the example of clothing
himself after the European fashion. He entertained
ambassadors and their wives and others at his palace as
other sovereigns did. He contemplated great reforms in
favour of his Christian subjects, but it will be seen that the
task was left incomplete for his successors.</p>

<p>At this point of his career Mahmoud had attained unqualified
success. He had succeeded in putting down
all the rebellious pashas, such as Ali of Janina and others.
Mehemet Ali of Egypt had recognized the supremacy of
the Sultan by sending his army and navy to suppress the
Greek rebellion. Greece had been practically reconquered.
The Greeks in other parts of the Empire had been terrorized
into submission. Insurrection in Moldavia and Wallachia
had been suppressed. The Serbian fortresses were in his
hands. Above all, the Janissaries, who had proved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
be so useless as a military force and who had murdered two
of his predecessors and deposed many others, were suppressed.
He had carried out great reforms in his Empire.
Mahmoud had effected all this by his own inflexible firmness
and by statesmanship of a high order, not unmixed
with cruelty and cunning.</p>

<p>Two events now occurred which materially affected the
position of Turkey, and deprived Mahmoud of the fruits
of his ably devised policy. The one was the death of
Alexander, the Emperor of Russia, the other the decision
of the British Government to intervene on behalf of Greece.
Alexander for some years past had been on the horns of a
dilemma. He had a deep sympathy for the subjects of
the Ottoman Empire who were members of the Greek
Church, and a great aversion to Turkish rule. But he also
hated and feared revolution. He believed in the divine
right of rulers, however bad, and would take no step to
support the revolt of their subjects, however oppressive
their government. He feared that a dangerous precedent
might be extended to his own Empire. This conflict of
views paralysed his action. He gave no assistance to
the Greek insurgents. So long as he lived there was
little hope that Greece would recover its independence.
He died late in 1825, and was succeeded by his brother,
Nicholas, a much younger and more vigorous man, and a
truer exponent of Russian ideals. The new Czar had no
objection to insurrection if it was not directed against his
own government. He hated the Turks and wished to drive
them out of Europe much more than he sympathized with
the Greeks. He had many other grounds of complaint
against the Porte. It has also been suggested that he
wished to come to conclusions with it before time had
been given for perfecting his new army.</p>

<p>As regards Great Britain, its Government had not
originally sympathized with the Greek revolution, but the
reverse. But public opinion, outraged by the barbarities
which had been committed, had produced an influence on
it, and Mr. Canning, the Foreign Secretary, was personally
very favourable to the cause of Greece. The Government
as a whole held the view that the continuance of disorder
in Greece was a menace to the peace of Europe. They
had no wish for the extension of Russia at the expense of
Turkey. They thought that if Greece were not pacified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Russia would intervene, and would not confine its claim to
the settlement of the Greek claims, but would aim at other
conquests. They decided, therefore, to make an effort to
settle the Greek question on the basis of autonomy, subject to
the suzerainty of the Sultan. In this view the Cabinet sent
the Duke of Wellington to St. Petersburg in 1826 to
negotiate with the Czar. He effected an arrangement which
was later embodied in the treaty of London of July 6, 1827,
between the three Powers, Great Britain, Russia, and
France, for the pacification of Greece. Under the terms
of this treaty it was agreed, with a view to bringing about
a reconciliation between the Ottoman Porte and the Greeks,
to offer mediation, and to demand an immediate armistice
as a preliminary to the opening of a negotiation.</p>

<p>Under the arrangement to be proposed to the Ottoman
Porte, Greece was to be granted complete autonomy, under
the suzerainty of the Sultan, and was to pay a fixed annual
tribute. It was to be governed by authorities whom its
people were to nominate. In order to bring about a
complete separation between the individuals of the two
nations and to prevent the collisions resulting from a long
struggle, the Greeks were to enter upon possession of all
Turkish property, either on the continent or in the isles of
Greece, on condition of indemnifying the former proprietors
by the payment of an annual sum to be added to the tribute.
By an additional secret article it was provided that “if, within
one month, the Ottoman Porte did not agree to accept the
mediation of the three Powers and consent to an armistice,
the signatories of the treaty would find the necessity for
an approximation with the Greeks by entering into relations
with them, and would employ all their means for the
accomplishment of the objects of the treaty without, however,
taking any part in the hostilities between the two
contending parties.”</p>

<p>In accordance with this treaty, a demand was made on
the Porte, by the ambassadors of the three Powers, for an
armistice, and for a pacification of Greece on the basis
above described. The Porte indignantly refused to entertain
the proposed mediation. It denied the right of the
Powers to intervene as regards its Greek subjects. In a
manifesto to its own people, the Porte justified its refusal
to mediate on the proposed basis. It denied that the
Greeks had any cause for complaint against the Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
rule. “It is notorious,” it said, “that these Greeks have
been treated like Mussulmans in every respect and as to
everything which regards their property, their personal
security, and the defence of their homes, and that they have
been loaded with benefits by the present Sultan.”</p>

<p>The negotiations between the Porte and the ambassadors
were protracted by the former, in order that an Egyptian
fleet, bringing large reinforcements to Ibrahim in Greece,
might arrive at Navarino before the conclusion of them.
After the final rejection of the proposals of the ambassadors,
instructions were given to the combined fleet of the three
Powers to effect a blockade of the Greek ports, and to
prevent the entrance or departure of any Turkish or
Egyptian vessels of war.</p>

<p>The combined fleet, under command of the British
admiral, Sir Edward Codrington, thereupon took up a
position outside the bay of Navarino. The admiral then
entered into negotiations with the Turkish admiral and
concluded an armistice on behalf of the Greeks. In spite
of this, the Egyptian troops, under Ibrahim Pasha, continued
to ravage the Morea in the most cruel manner,
devastating property, murdering the men, and carrying off
the young women for sale as slaves in Egypt. As the
winter was approaching, the British admiral thought it
would be difficult to maintain his position outside the bay.
He determined, therefore, to enter the bay with his fleet.
The combined fleet consisted of ten vessels of the line, ten
frigates and smaller vessels, with about twelve hundred
guns. The Turko-Egyptian fleet consisted of five ships
of the line, fifteen frigates, and sixty-two smaller vessels,
armed with two thousand guns. It was anchored in a
crescent facing the entrance of the bay. There were also
batteries on shore commanding the entrance of the bay.
The allied fleet entered the bay without opposition from
these batteries and anchored in a line alongside of the
Turkish and Egyptian vessels.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the position was a most critical one,
almost certain to lead to an armed conflict. The Turks
fired the first gun and broke the armistice, whether intentionally,
or not, is not quite clear. The challenge was
taken up. There followed a fierce battle between the two
fleets. In a few hours of this 20th of October, 1827, the
Turko-Egyptian fleet was completely destroyed. With the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
exception of some of the smaller craft, all the vessels were
sunk or burnt. Their crews had fought valiantly, but they
were no match for those of the allied fleet. But their
guns caused much loss of life and did much damage, and
the British battleships, after the battle, were compelled to
return to England for repairs. The batteries on shore
did not begin to fire until the allied fleet had taken position.
They might have effected much more damage if they had
fired on the fleet when entering the bay. A more complete
destruction of a fleet had never occurred.</p>

<p>This great victory gave no satisfaction to the British
Government. The spirit of Canning no longer inspired
it. He had died since the initiation of the policy which
inevitably led to this naval battle. On the meeting of the
British Parliament, early in 1828, the Speech from the
Throne referred to the battle in the following terms: “His
Majesty deeply laments that this conflict should have occurred
with the naval force of our ancient ally. He still
entertains a confident hope that this untoward event will
not be followed by further hostilities.” The Duke of
Wellington, who was now Prime Minister, when challenged
in the House of Lords as to the expression ‘untoward
event,’ said:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Ottoman Empire was an essential part of the balance of power
in Europe. Its preservation had been for many years an object to the
whole of Europe. While he acquitted the British admiral of all blame,
he pointed out that, under the treaty of London, one of the stipulations
was that the operation was not to lead to hostilities. When, therefore, the
operation under the treaty did lead to hostilities, it certainly was an
untoward event.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is difficult, however, to conceive how the Duke, who had
negotiated the treaty with the Czar of Russia, could have
supposed that, in the event of the Sultan not agreeing to
the terms of mediation, the use of force against him could
be avoided.</p>

<p>However that might have been, the destruction of the
Ottoman fleet at Navarino was of momentous importance.
It cut off the communication between Ibrahim Pasha and
Egypt. It restored to Greece command of the sea in the
archipelago. It assured the supremacy of the Russian fleet
in the Black Sea. This last was of enormous value to the
Russians in the war which soon broke out with Turkey. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
facilitated the capture of Varna, and enabled the Russian
army to advance across the Balkans and to threaten
Constantinople.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Pasha, finding his position in the Morea untenable,
entered into a convention with the British admiral
under which he was permitted to withdraw the Egyptian
army from Greece and embark it for Alexandria without
molestation from the allied fleet. There remained in the
Morea only the Turkish troops. They held most of the
fortresses there. Later, a French army, under General
Maison, was, by agreement with the allies, sent to the Morea.
It soon cleared the whole country of the Turkish troops.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Sultan at Constantinople, in spite of the
destruction of his fleet at Navarino, still maintained an
obstinate refusal to accede to the terms of the treaty of
London. The ambassadors of England and France thereupon
left the city. Differences then began to arise between
the three allied Powers. The Emperor of Russia proposed
to employ coercive measures against Turkey, and
for this purpose to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia.
England and France rejected the proposal. They wished
to preserve the Ottoman Empire as well as to secure the
independence of Greece. But the Greek question was only
one of the complaints of Russia against Turkey. It had
also grave reasons to complain that the treaty of Bucharest
and the later treaty of Akermann of 1826, confirming and
extending it, were disregarded by the Porte, which still
occupied Moldavia, Wallachia, and Serbia by its armies.
The Sultan, in a manifesto to his own people, had publicly
announced that he had entered into the treaty of Akermann
with the full intention of not being bound by its terms, and
that he regarded Russia as his hereditary foe.</p>

<p>On April 26, 1828, Russia declared war against Turkey.
England and France found themselves in a position when
they could not object, for the Porte still refused their
demands as regards Greece. They had joined with Russia
in destroying the Turkish fleet. They were now compelled
to stand by while the Russians invaded Turkey. The
position, and still more the results of the war, showed
what a grave error Mahmoud committed when he refused
to agree to the scheme of the allied Powers for granting
autonomy to Greece under the suzerainty of Turkey. If
he had accepted, his fleet would have been intact. England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
and France would have been in a position to object to
Russia’s schemes. As it was, Greece secured an absolute
independence, and Wallachia, Moldavia, and Serbia were
soon, by the victories of Russia, to secure the status of
complete autonomy which the Sultan had refused to
Greece.</p>

<p>The Emperor Nicholas, in nominal command of his army,
crossed the Pruth on May 7, 1828. His force consisted of
not more than sixty-five thousand men, a surprisingly small
number for the greatest military Power in Europe to put
into the field. It was necessary, however, to keep a large
army in Poland, where an outbreak was expected. Another
army was stationed in the Ukraine to watch Austria, who
regarded the Russian attack on Turkey with suspicion and
malevolence; and a fourth army of thirty thousand men,
under General Paskiewich, invaded Asia Minor from the
Caucasus. With the main army it was hoped to cross
the Balkans and to menace Constantinople. The Turks
offered no resistance in Moldavia and Wallachia. But it
was not till June 8th that the Russians were able to effect
a crossing over the Danube. The Sultan, on his part,
commenced the campaign under great disadvantages. His
old army of Janissaries had recently been destroyed. The
new army, equipped and drilled in the fashion of European
armies, was very raw and ill-trained. It consisted of very
young men, who were recruited with difficulty, often by
compulsion, for the new service was very unpopular, and
the older men could not be induced to join. It did not
count more than forty-five thousand men, exclusive of the
artillery. It was supplemented by irregulars from Asia,
and the total force under arms was estimated at one hundred
and eighty thousand men, of whom, after providing for
the defence of Constantinople and the Dardanelles, for a
reserve at Adrianople and for other demands on the Empire
in Europe and Asia, there remained only fifty thousand
men to oppose the Russians in Bulgaria, and to provide
garrisons for the fortresses on the Danube and for Schumla
and Varna. These garrisons, however, were supported by
the armed Turkish inhabitants of the towns, who could
be relied on for a vigorous resistance. The Turks were
under the further disadvantage that the greater part of
their fleet had been destroyed at Navarino. The Russians
were, in consequence, completely masters in the Black Sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
They were able to send to the Ægean archipelago another
fleet, which blockaded the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties, the Turks made an unexpectedly
vigorous defence against the Russian invasion in
Europe. The campaign of 1828 was mainly one of sieges,
where the Turkish soldiers, supported by Moslems of the
fortified towns, fought to the best advantage behind walls
and earthworks. They could make but a poor stand in the
open against their better trained enemy.</p>

<p>The Russians, after crossing the Danube, laid siege to
Ibrail, the most important fortress on the lower stretch
of the river, and which it was essentially necessary to
capture before making an advance to Schumla. The
garrison and inhabitants made a gallant resistance, and
it was only after five weeks that it was compelled to surrender,
on June 17th. The Russian army was then divided
into three parts—the one to attack Silistria, the capture of
which was almost as necessary as that of Ibrail; the second
to besiege Varna; the third and most important, under the
Emperor, to march to Schumla. The attack on Silistria
failed, and after some weeks the force employed against
it marched in the direction of Schumla to support the
Czar’s army. Even with this addition it was found
impossible to invest the fortified camp of the Turks behind
Schumla, and, after a demonstration, it was compelled
to hold a defensive position, in front of Schumla, while
the Czar and a part of the army marched in support of
the division before Varna.</p>

<p>On August 18th the Czar arrived there with a reinforcement
of nine thousand men, and the siege then commenced,
while the Russian Black Sea fleet of eight ships of the
line and three frigates, under command of Admiral Greig,
joined in the attack from the sea. The Turks again made
a desperate and prolonged defence, which might have been
successful if it had not been that Jussuf Pasha, in
command of the garrison, with five thousand of his men,
traitorously deserted the city, on October 14th, and threw
themselves on the mercy of the Czar. The remainder
of the garrison, under the Capitan Pasha, refused to be
a party to the surrender. It was said that the cause of
this extraordinary act of treachery was that the Sultan,
in pursuance of his policy of concentrating all power and
authority in himself, had been persuaded by an intrigue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
to confiscate the property of Jussuf, who was one of the few
large landowners in Turkey, while the owner was gallantly
fighting the enemy at Varna. However that may be, the
remaining garrison was soon compelled to capitulate, and
this most important stronghold fell into the hands of the
Russians. Without it no advance could possibly have been
made across the Balkans.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1828 came to an end with the surrender
of Varna. Though the Russians had been able to capture
two of the four fortresses which barred their way to the
Balkans, the campaign had not been without success to
the Turks. They had shown unexpected powers of resistance,
and had prevented for a year the achievement
of the main object of the Russians—their advance to Constantinople.
The losses of the Russians had been very
great, not only in the sieges, but by disease, which dogged
their armies as usual.</p>

<p>Baron von Moltke, the German general, who, at the
invitation of the Sultan, was with the Turkish headquarters
during this war, writes of the Russian and Turkish troops
in his remarkable history of it:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The faults of the Russian Staff were atoned for by the innate excellence
of the Russian troops. The self-sacrificing obedience of the commanders,
the steadiness of the common soldiers, their power of endurance and
unshaken bravery in times of danger, were the qualities that enabled
them to avert the dangers of their position before Schumla and to hold
the Turks in check, and to make up for all deficiencies and overcome all
resistance at Varna.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of the Turks he adds:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We cannot say much for the skill of the Turkish commanders, but the
conduct of the Turks, from the highest officers to the last soldier at
the storming of Ibrail, their courage and steadiness in the mines and
trenches before Varna, were far above all praise.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Asia the Turks had not done so well. General
Paskiewich was able to defeat the army in front of him
and to capture the important stronghold of Kars and its
adjoining district.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1829 began late. It was not till the
middle of May that the Russian army again took the field,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>not on this occasion under the Czar, but under General
Diebitsch, who proved to be a most able general and
diplomatist. The army was again most inadequate for
the campaign which was in contemplation—namely, the
crossing of the Balkans and an advance to Constantinople.
It consisted of no more than sixty-eight thousand men, a
force which, in these days, eighty-eight years later, would
count for little or nothing. It was thought necessary, as a
condition precedent to any advance, to capture Silistria. The
siege was commenced on May 17, 1829. The Russian
force detailed for this was not more than fourteen thousand
men. The Turks who defended it were twenty-one thousand
in number, including eight thousand armed inhabitants.
In spite of this disparity of numbers, the town was captured
after a siege of forty-four days, on July 26th, at a loss
to the Russians of two thousand five hundred men.</p>

<p>In the meantime Diebitsch had advanced with the main
army in the direction of Schumla. Reschid Pasha, who
had replaced Hussein Pasha as Grand Vizier and Seraskier,
issued from Schumla with forty thousand men, and on
June 18th a great battle took place at Kulewtska. The
Turks were utterly defeated by a very inferior force of
Russians. They had begun the battle with an impetuous
charge, but they could not sustain it against the serried
ranks of the Russian veterans. Some ammunition wagons
exploded and, as often happened with the Turks, a wild
panic ensued. They fled from the field of battle and
dispersed in all directions. All their artillery fell into the
hands of the Russians. Reschid escaped at the head of
six hundred men and found his way to Schumla, where
there were ten thousand Turks, and where a large
number of fugitives from the battle eventually found
refuge. This victory at Kulewtska had far-reaching effects.
It was the first great battle in which the new troops of
Mahmoud were tested. It showed that the Russian soldiers
had an overwhelming superiority.</p>

<p>Silistria fell on July 13th. The Russians who had been
engaged in the siege then joined Diebitsch before Schumla.
The general thereupon decided on the bold and even
perilous course of crossing the Balkans, without previously
capturing Schumla and its army. Leaving ten thousand
men to mask that fortress, where a much greater force
of Turks was now assembled, consisting largely of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
demoralized by the recent defeat, Diebitsch commenced
his march with such secrecy that for some days the Turks
were not aware of it. Reschid Pasha, expecting an attack
on Schumla, and thinking his force insufficient for its
defence, had called in the various corps who were posted
for the defence of the mountain passes. Diebitsch therefore
met with no opposition. He crossed the mountains
in nine days of forced marches fraught with great hardship
to his troops. When south of the mountain range,
he deflected his route to the Black Sea and got into communication
with the Russian fleet, under Admiral Greig,
which assisted in the capture of Bourgas and other ports
along the coast, and afforded supplies to Diebitsch’s army.</p>

<p>Three battles were fought south of the mountains, at
Aidos, Karnabad and Slivno, where small divisions of Turks
were defeated and dispersed. After three weeks from
crossing the Balkans, Diebitsch arrived in front of
Adrianople, a city of eighty thousand inhabitants, with a
garrison of ten thousand men. His army was by this time
reduced to less than twenty thousand men. Its appearance
before Adrianople caused wild panic. Never before had
a hostile army crossed the southern range of the Balkans.
It was thought to be impossible. It was confidently believed
that the Russian army numbered over one hundred thousand
men. The city and its garrison surrendered without making
a show of fight. Everywhere on its route through Bulgaria
the Christian raya population had received the invaders
with acclamation and the Turks had thrown away their
arms and fled. The campaign of 1829 in Asia had been
almost equally disastrous to the Turks. Paskiewich had
defeated them in a pitched battle and had captured Erzerum.
He was now approaching Trebizond, after dispersing
an army on the way.</p>

<p>When news reached Constantinople of the crossing of
the Balkans and the capture of Adrianople, there was consternation
and dismay among Turks of all classes. The
Sultan almost alone maintained his presence of mind. He
issued a proclamation calling on all the Turks in the city
to join in its defence. He announced his intention to
take command in person. The sacred banner of the Prophet
was unfurled. But when, at the first review of the forces,
the Sultan appeared in a carriage and not on horseback,
this “unheard of and indecorous innovation” chilled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
enthusiasm of the volunteers, and undid the good which
was expected from his action.</p>

<p>There was no great zeal for the defence of the capital.
The chief ministers of the Porte were unanimous in
advising the Sultan to sue for terms of peace. They were
quite ignorant of the weakness of the Russian army. They
believed the stories that more than a hundred thousand men
were advancing on the capital. There were no troops
at Constantinople, they said, able to meet this army. The
ambassadors of England and France, who had recently
returned to Constantinople, at the invitation of the Sultan,
backed up the ministers, and urgently advised him to come
to terms with the enemy. We now know that all this
advice and these alarms were founded on false information
and that there was no real justification for them.
In fact, the real position of the Russian army was one
of extreme danger. It had suffered great losses on the
battlefields and from the hardships of the forced marches,
and was also being decimated by disease. There was
no possibility of its being reinforced. Retreat across the
Balkans was almost impossible. The Turkish army at
Schumla was now reinforced. On its flank there was an
army of twenty thousand Albanians, under the rebellious
Pasha of Scotra, who had refused aid to the Porte in the
earlier part of the campaign, but who, now that the existence
of the Empire was threatened, might confidently be expected
to come to its aid. Advance to Constantinople might also
be dangerous, if not impossible. It was distant one
hundred and forty miles. Its garrison of thirty thousand
men, supplemented by fresh volunteers, might be relied on
to meet the Russians, now reduced to much less than twenty
thousand. These difficulties of the Russian army, however,
were not known to the Porte.</p>

<p>In view of the strong pressure brought to bear upon
him, the Sultan, for once in his life, gave way, and agreed
to send plenipotentiaries to Adrianople to discuss terms of
peace. Diebitsch well knew the danger of his position,
and was anxious to make peace, but he maintained an
attitude of firmness and confidence. He was ready, he
said, to discuss terms, but he was equally willing to advance
with his army against the capital. Already a part of his
army was pressed forward. It occupied a line from the
Black Sea at Kilia to Enos in the archipelago—a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
of over one hundred miles, much too long for his weak
force. It is recognized by Moltke and all military authorities
that if the Porte had stood firm and had refused to
agree to terms, Diebitsch could not have made good his
threatened attack on the capital. In the history of war
there has never been a more successful case of ‘bluff.’
The Porte gave in to unreasoning and ill-informed fear,
and on September 19th peace was concluded between the
two Powers and the treaty of Adrianople was signed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is certain [said Moltke] that this treaty released Diebitsch from a
position as perilous as could well be conceived, and which, if prolonged
for a few more days, might have caused him to be hurled down from
the summit of victory to the lowest depth of ruin and destruction.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The terms of peace agreed to were moderate, so far as
Russia itself was concerned, though very serious in their
effect on the Ottoman Empire. The Czar had proclaimed
at the outset of the war that he had no desire for territorial
aggrandizement. He fully adhered to this promise. With
two comparatively small exceptions, Russia gave up all
the territory which it had conquered in the war, both in
Europe and Asia. It retained only a small part of
Moldavia which gave access to the Sulina mouth of
the Danube, a position of great importance to it in the
future. In Asia, Kars and Erzerum were given back to
Turkey. In Europe, the Pruth continued to be the
boundary of the two States. But Moldavia and Wallachia,
though nominally restored to the Ottoman Empire, were
practically freed from it. They were to enjoy complete
autonomy. The Hospodars, in future, were to be appointed
for life. The two States were to be allowed to raise
armies independent of the Porte. The tribute payable in
future was to be fixed, and could not be increased.
Religious and commercial freedom were to be secured to
them. The Sultan was to be their suzerain and nothing
more. This meant practical independence. The same
privileges were secured for Serbia, with the exception that
the Porte was to be permitted to garrison the fortresses of
Belgrade and Orsova. The Turks were required to depart
from all other parts of the country. Silistria was to be
returned to Turkey, but other fortresses on the Danube were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>to be razed. That river, therefore, ceased to be the first
defence of the Turkish Empire to the north. An indemnity
of eleven and a half million ducats, equal to five millions
sterling, was to be paid by Turkey for the expenses of
Russia in the war. The payment was to be spread over
ten years, and the territory occupied by Russia was not to
be wholly surrendered till this was effected.</p>

<p>As regards Greece, the treaty embodied and made obligatory
on the Sultan the provisions of the treaty of London
of July, 1827, between the three Powers, and the further
protocol between them of March 1829, which defined
the future limits of Greece. Under the protocol, the
boundary line was to run from the Gulf of Volo to the
Gulf of Arta, so as to include the greater part of Thessaly.
The country south of this was to be subject to a monarchical
government, hereditary in a Christian prince to be chosen
by the three Powers, with the consent of the Porte and
under the suzerainty of the Sultan, and with an administration
best calculated to ensure its religious and commercial
liberty. This proposal had been submitted to the Sultan by
the ambassadors of England and France on March 22, 1829.
He had then obstinately refused to have anything to say to
it. When the Russians had crossed the Balkans, the Sultan,
in the hope of propitiating England and France, offered to
the ambassadors to agree to an autonomous Greece under
a Hospodar, limited, however, to the Morea. This the
ambassadors refused. The Porte, under the treaty with
Russia, now agreed to their full demand.</p>

<p>The Governments of England and France appear to have
taken umbrage at the action of Russia in dealing with the
subject of Greece in a separate treaty with the Porte. It
was thought that the Czar wished to get all the credit of
liberating Greece from Turkish rule. They therefore informed
the Russian Government that the execution of the
treaty of London of 1827 did not belong to the Czar alone,
but was to be the work of the three Governments. In
consequence of this a further conference took place in
London, at which it was decided that the suzerainty of the
Sultan over Greece was to be abolished, and complete independence
was to be secured to the Greeks. They also came
to the unfortunate decision that the line of boundary of the
new kingdom was to be greatly restricted, and instead of
running from the Gulf of Volo to the Gulf of Arta, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
to be drawn from the mouth of the Archilous to the
mouth of the Sperkius, thus excluding from the new kingdom
the whole of Acarnania and the greater part of
Thessaly, where the population was almost wholly Greek.
They also decided that Crete was not to be included, but
was to be restored to Turkish rule. Mr. Finlay says of
this: “Diplomatic ignorance could not have traced a more
unsuitable boundary.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The Sultan agreed to this new project. He probably
preferred a smaller Greece with complete independence to
a larger one with full autonomy, subject to his suzerainty.
Greece was accordingly recalled into national existence with
a greatly reduced area, leaving outside large districts with
completely homogeneous Greek populations. This was
fraught with grave difficulties in the future. One effect
of it was that Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who, later,
as King of the Belgians, proved to be one of the most
able rulers of his day, refused to accept the throne of
Greece on the ground that its area was too restricted,
and Otho, a son of the King of Bavaria, was selected by
the Powers for the post, and proved to be a most incompetent
and reactionary ruler. It would seem that Lord
Aberdeen, who was Minister of Foreign Affairs in England
at the time, and who was mainly responsible for these
changes, was anxious to restrict the kingdom of Greece to
the smallest possible area.</p>

<p>Reverting to the treaty of Adrianople, it is to be observed
that while Russia acquired a very insignificant extension
of territory, and was content with the prestige of having
dictated its terms, and with having acquired a position such
that it might insist on its behests to the Porte, as regards
its Christian subjects, being obeyed in the future, Turkey
lost very greatly. It was said that the Sultan, after signing
the treaty, shut himself up in his palace at Therapia for
weeks in gloomy despair. There was much cause for
this. The treaty was a complete surrender of all that he
had been contending for since his accession to the throne.
It was humiliating to himself and his Turkish subjects. It
was the inevitable precursor of much that was to occur to
other parts of his Empire. His grief and indignation must
have been greatly aggravated when he came to know the
real condition of the Russian army at Adrianople and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>appreciate that, if he had stood firm in resisting the advice
of his ministers and of the ambassadors, the Russian army
would have been quite unable to make an advance against
Constantinople. This, however, should not lead us to
forget the supreme error which Mahmoud committed
in refusing to come to terms with the three Powers as
regards Greece after the treaty of London. If in 1827,
the Sultan had been willing to make concessions in the
direction of autonomy to Greece, it is nearly certain that
there would have been no declaration of war on the part
of Russia, and in the event of war he would not have
been wanting in allies. His fleet would not have been
destroyed at Navarino, and time would have been afforded
to him to reorganize his army and to make it effective
against those of the Christian Powers. As it was, not only
did he lose all real hold over Moldavia, Wallachia, and
Serbia, not only did Greece gain its independence, but he
was soon to lose all real authority in Egypt, a Moslem
country, except the barren right of suzerainty of the Sultan
and a fixed tribute in money.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that when, in 1824, the Sultan
invited the aid of the Pasha of Egypt to crush rebellion in
Greece, Mehemet Ali only consented to lend his army and
fleet on the express promise that the Pashalics of Syria,
Damascus, Tripoli (in Asia), and Crete would be given
to him, in addition to that of Egypt. But when in 1827,
after the destruction of the Turko-Egyptian fleet at
Navarino and the expulsion of the Egyptian army from
the Morea, Mehemet Ali pressed for the performance of
this promise, he met with a blank refusal, except as regards
the island of Crete, the Pashalic of which alone was conferred
on him. Mehemet was very indignant at this breach
of promise, and determined to seize by force the provinces
which he coveted. He set to work with great resolution
to build another fleet, in place of that which had been
burnt or sunk, and to improve and strengthen his army.</p>

<p>By 1832 he completed these preparations for war. He
then picked a quarrel with the Pasha of Syria and, pretending
to make war against him and not against the
Sultan, sent an army, under Ibrahim, across the desert
into Syria. It captured Gaza and Jerusalem without difficulty,
and then marched to Acre, where the Egyptian fleet
met it and co-operated in a successful attack on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
fortress. After this success Ibrahim marched with his army
to Aleppo and Damascus, defeating two Turkish armies.
He then crossed the mountains into Asia Minor, and fought
another great battle at Konia on October 27, 1832, and
defeated a large Turkish army. He then marched to Brusa.</p>

<p>These disasters caused the greatest alarm at Constantinople.
There was no other Turkish army in the field
capable of resisting the march of Ibrahim’s army to the
Bosphorus. In his peril the Sultan appealed to the British
Government for aid against the Egyptians, offering a close
alliance for the future. He met with a refusal, at the
instance of Lord Palmerston, who did not then appear to
value a Turkish alliance, though the British Ambassador
at Constantinople, Sir Stratford Canning, strongly advised
it. Mahmoud then appealed for aid to the Emperor of
Russia, who gladly availed himself of the opportunity of
increasing his influence in Turkey and of effecting a
virtual protectorate over it. For a second time, within
recent years, a close alliance was formed between the Czar
and the Sultan, and in February, 1833, a Russian fleet
issuing from Sebastopol conveyed an army to the Bosphorus
for the defence of Constantinople.</p>

<p>For a time the influence of Russia became predominant.
None but Russians had access to the Sultan. Russian
troops and sailors were seen everywhere, and Russian
officers were employed to drill and command the Turkish
battalions. This state of things caused great alarm to the
British and French Governments. They were both concerned
in preventing Russia obtaining possession or control
of Constantinople. They felt it was necessary to stay
the advance of Ibrahim’s victorious army, which was the
excuse for the presence of the Russians at Constantinople.
They offered, therefore, to the Sultan that if he would
insist on the withdrawal of the Russian army from his capital,
they would guarantee him against the further invasion of
Mehemet Ali’s army. France, though always very friendly
to Mehemet Ali, and in favour of his independence as
against the Sultan, had no wish to see Constantinople in
the hands of Russia.</p>

<p>By dint of great diplomatic pressure, in which Lord
Palmerston took the leading part with the greatest ability,
a double arrangement was effected. On the one hand,
Mehemet Ali, perceiving that he would be powerless to attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Constantinople against the opposition of Russia, England,
and France, was induced to come to terms with the Sultan.
A convention was signed between them in 1833, and a
firman was issued by the Porte under which Mehemet was
confirmed as the Pasha, not only of Egypt, but of Syria,
Damascus, Adana, Tripoli, and Crete, an immense accession
of dignity and power to him. The Sultan was to
be suzerain and the Pashalics were conferred on Mehemet
Ali only for his life, and there was no promise that they
would be continued to his son Ibrahim or other descendants.
The concession, however, as it stood, was most humiliating
to the Sultan. On the other hand, Russia agreed with
the Porte to withdraw its troops from Constantinople and
the Bosphorus, but only on the promise, embodied in the
treaty of Hunkar Iskelesi, that Russian ships of war should
have the privilege of passing through the Bosphorus and
Dardanelles, at any time, without obtaining the consent of
the Porte, a privilege which was to be denied to the ships
of other Powers, unless with the previous consent of Russia.
It also secured to Russia the right to send an army to
the Bosphorus and land it there whenever the exigencies
of the Turkish Empire made it expedient to do so. The
firman to Mehemet Ali was dated May 5, 1833, and the
treaty of Hunkar Iskelesi was agreed to with Russia on
July 8th of the same year. By these two measures, the
result of a great diplomatic struggle, the menace of
Mehemet Ali against Constantinople, which at one time
seemed likely to involve all the Powers in Europe in war,
was brought to an end. The Egyptian army was withdrawn
into the provinces added to the Pashalic of Mehemet
Ali, and the Russian troops were recalled by the Czar from
Constantinople.</p>

<p>After this settlement, very favourable both to Russia
and Egypt, but humiliating to Turkey, a period of a few
years’ repose was accorded to the Sultan, so far as his
relations with the Emperor Nicholas and Mehemet Ali were
concerned. But there were frequent internal troubles and
outbreaks, which were put down by Mahmoud, not without
some difficulty. Both Mahmoud and Mehemet Ali spent
the interval in making preparations for another encounter.
Mahmoud could not acquiesce in the virtual independence
of so large a part of his Empire under Mehemet Ali. The
latter was determined to convert his Pashalic into an here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>ditary
one and to attain virtual independence of the Porte.
He had ambitions also to supplant Mahmoud as the head
of the Ottoman Empire. The Sultan, during this time,
employed a large number of Prussian officers, under Colonel
von Moltke—later to become so famous in the Franco-German
War of 1870 in command of the German army—to
train his army, while Mehemet Ali again employed
French officers for the same purpose. Five years elapsed
before war again broke out between them.</p>

<p>In 1838 Mehemet Ali, having completed all his arrangements
for war with his suzerain, announced his intention
to pay no more tribute in the future to the Porte. This
amounted to a declaration of independence and a renunciation
of allegiance. Mahmoud, on his part, was determined
to crush his rebellious vassal, and collected an army
on the Euphrates for the invasion of Syria. The opportunity
seemed to be a favourable one, as the population
of Syria was in revolt against Mehemet Ali, whose government
had proved to be almost as oppressive and tyrannical
as that of the Sultan. Early in 1839 Mahmoud declared
war and gave directions to his army to invade Syria.
He also fitted out a fleet, consisting of nine ships of the
line and twenty-four smaller vessels, and directed it to proceed
to Syria and to co-operate with his army advancing
from the Euphrates.</p>

<p>Both these expeditions of the Porte came to grief. The
army which invaded Syria met the Egyptians, again under
command of Ibrahim, at Nazeb on June 25, 1839. The two
armies were about equal in number, each of them about
forty thousand. The Turks were completely defeated.
Many of their battalions deserted on the field of battle and
went over to the enemy; the remainder were routed and
dispersed. Six thousand of them were killed and wounded;
ten thousand were taken prisoners. One hundred guns and
great masses of stores fell into the hands of the Egyptians.
The Turkish army in these parts ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The great Turkish fleet had sailed from the Bosphorus
on July 6th amid many popular demonstrations. It was
under the command of the Capitan Pasha, Achmet, who
proved to be a traitor. After passing through the
Dardanelles, instead of following his instructions by making
his course to the coast of Syria, Achmet sailed direct to
Egypt, and there entered the port of Alexandria with flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
colours and handed over the fleet to the enemy of the
Sultan, the rebellious Pasha Mehemet Ali, a proceeding
without precedent in history. It was only accomplished,
we may presume, by profuse bribery on the part of the
crafty Pasha.</p>

<p>Mahmoud was spared the knowledge of these two signal
disasters to his Empire. He died on July 1, 1839, some
writers allege from the effect of alcohol, though this is
doubtful. Creasy and many other historians are unstinting
in praise of Mahmoud. They assign to him a very high
position in the list of Sultans. They bear testimony to his
high civic courage, and to the firm resolution with which
he confronted the many crises of his reign. We must
fully admit these qualities. Few sovereigns in history have
had to deal with such a succession of grave difficulties.
Almost alone he bore the weight of Empire. We must
not, however, lose sight of the fact that his administration
and diplomacy were fraught with failure, that his Empire
incurred greater losses than under any previous Sultan, that
his armies met with invariable defeat, not only on the
part of numerically weaker armies of Russia, but also from
insurgent Greeks and Serbians, and even from Egyptians,
whose fighting qualities were much inferior to those of the
Turks. His firmness and resolution were very great, but
they failed him at the supreme crisis of his career, when
the Russian army, with quite inadequate numbers, after
serious losses in battle and by disease, threatened Constantinople
from Adrianople, and when it is now quite certain
that, if Mahmoud had stood firm and had refused to come
to terms, overwhelming disaster must have befallen the
Russians. At another crisis also his firmness amounted
to most unwise obstinacy when he refused, in 1827, to
concede autonomy to Greece at the instance of the Great
Powers—a supreme error from which all his subsequent
misfortunes logically followed. Mahmoud seems also to
have been wanting in magnetism to inspire his generals and
soldiers with his own courage and resolution. He does
not compare in this respect with his contemporary and
rival, Mehemet Ali. He had little of the martial vigour
and of the craft of that great vassal. If the Great Powers
had not intervened, it was highly probable, if not certain,
that Ibrahim’s army would, either in 1833 or in 1839,
have marched to Constantinople, have effected a revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
there, and have put an end to the Othman dynasty. It
might have given new life to the decadent Turkish Empire.
In any case, there was no reason why Mahmoud, if he
had been endowed with Mehemet Ali’s genius and administrative
capacity, should not have created an army superior
in force and discipline to that of the Egyptian Pasha, and
equal to the task of preventing the Russians from crossing
the Balkans.</p>

<h2><small>XX</small><br /><br />

THE RULE OF ELCHIS<br />

<small>1839-76</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mahmoud</span> was succeeded by his son, Abdul Mehzid, a
youth of sixteen years, who proved to be of very different
stamp from his father. He was of mild and gentle nature,
without physical or mental vigour, and wanting in force
of character. He was enfeebled early in his reign by
excessive indulgence in his harem. Later he was addicted
to alcohol, like many of his predecessors. His father had
monopolized power, and had frequently changed his
ministers, with the result that he left no statesman behind
him who could impose his will on the young Sultan and
govern in his name. Nor was any lady of the harem
ambitious and competent to guide or misguide the ship
of State, as had not infrequently been the case in the
past, when the reigning Sultan was unequal to the task.
The main power during this reign as regards foreign
affairs, and to some extent even as regards internal affairs,
seems to have been vested in the ambassadors of the Great
Powers. This power was exercised collectively by them
on the rare occasions when they were unanimously agreed,
but at other times by one or other of them, and
chiefly, as will be seen, by the British Ambassador, Sir
Stratford Canning, later Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, who,
by his force of character and commanding presence,
obtained immense personal influence over the feeble mind
of Abdul Mehzid, and exercised an almost undisputed
sway from 1842 to 1858, with the exception of brief
intervals when he was in England on leave, and when the
Russian Ambassador succeeded in obtaining exclusive
influence.</p>

<p>The new Sultan was fortunate, as compared with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
father, that in the thirty-one years of his reign his
Empire experienced no serious loss of territory. It
is necessary, however, to advert to the two main events
of it—the one, the suppression of Mehemet Ali’s ambitious
projects and the restriction of his hereditary Pashalic to
Egypt; the other, the Crimean War, as it is known in
history—the war with Russia, the effect of which was to
stave off for nearly twenty years the dismemberment of
the Turkish Empire in Europe.</p>

<p>As regards the first of these events, it has been shown
that, in the last year of Mahmoud’s reign, Mehemet Ali
was in a position of great strength, which might have
enabled him to overthrow the Othman dynasty. He had
destroyed the main Turkish army in Asia, at Nazeb, on
the frontier of Syria, and by the infamous treachery of
Achmet Pasha he had obtained possession of the Turkish
fleet. He comported himself, however, with moderation
at this stage. He informed the Porte that he was willing
to come to terms if they would recognize the Pashalics of
Egypt, Syria, Tripoli (in Asia Minor), Adana, and Crete
as hereditary in his family. He had no intention, he
said, to use the Turkish fleet against his suzerain, the
Sultan. He would give it back to the Porte, if his terms
were agreed to. If Sultan Mahmoud had been alive, it may
be confidently assumed that he would have rejected these
terms with contumely, and would have fought it out with
his rebellious vassal. But Abdul Mehzid was wanting in
courage to meet the crisis. The two disasters caused the
greatest alarm at Constantinople. The majority of the
Divan were ready to concede the demands of Mehemet
Ali. They were prevented from doing so by an unprecedented
occurrence. The ambassadors of the five Great
Powers—England, France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia—met
in conclave and came to the conclusion that it was
contrary to the interests of their respective Governments
that Mehemet Ali’s demands should be acceded to. They
informed the Porte that their Governments desired to
discuss the questions raised by Mehemet Ali, and invited
the Sultan to suspend a definitive arrangement with him.
This was agreed to by the Divan. The settlement of the
relation of the rebellious pasha to the Sultan fell into the
hands of the ambassadors, and a kind of tutelage was
established over the Turkish Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>The conduct of the Emperor Nicholas on this occasion
was most conciliatory to the other Powers. He intimated
to them that, if they were united on a scheme to settle the
Egyptian question, he would not insist on the special
right which he had acquired under the treaties of Bucharest
and of Akermann to exclude the ships of war of other
Powers from the Dardanelles, and that he would withdraw his
few remaining troops from Constantinople and the Bosphorus.
Lord Palmerston, on behalf of Great Britain, expressed
his admiration of this attitude of the Russian Emperor.
As a result, a conference took place in London between
the representatives of the Great Powers, at which Lord
Palmerston, on behalf of England, and Baron Brunnow,
on behalf of Russia, took the leading part. Grave difference
soon arose at the conference on the part of France.
Its Government, though strongly opposed to Russia obtaining
possession of Constantinople, had always been favourable
to the claim of Mehemet Ali to an hereditary Pashalic
in Egypt and Syria, and had secretly encouraged him
to make himself independent of the Porte. It now
supported him against the veto of the other Powers.
Eventually England, Russia, and Austria, finding that they
could not come to agreement with France, decided to act
without its concurrence, and to compel Mehemet Ali to
evacuate Syria and to restore to the Porte the Turkish
fleet. After long discussion between these three Powers,
a convention was agreed to on July 15, 1840. They
presented an ultimatum to Mehemet Ali, calling upon him
to submit himself to the Porte. They promised that if,
within ten days of the receipt of the ultimatum, he would
give orders for the withdrawal of his army from Syria,
and would give up the Turkish fleet to the Porte, he
would be recognized as hereditary Pasha of Egypt and
as Pasha of Syria for his own life; but, if not, the
offer of the life Pashalic of Syria and the hereditary
Pashalic of Egypt would be withdrawn, and he would
have to content himself with the Pashalic for life of Egypt.
It was also intimated to him that if there was refusal or
delay the fleets of the three Powers would at once institute
a blockade of Egypt and Syria. This ultimatum of the
three Powers, when it became known in France, caused
the most profound indignation; the more so when, on
the refusal of Mehemet Ali to accede to the ultimatum, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
British fleet, supported by war vessels of the two other
Powers, made its appearance on the coast of Syria. This
was thought to be an insult to France. War between that
country and England was imminent. There were violent
scenes in the French Chambers, and most bitterly hostile
articles in the French papers. There were threats of war
on the part of the Government of France. But prudent
counsels ultimately prevailed, when it was discovered that
France was not prepared for a naval war, and that its
fleet could not hope to contend with the British fleet in
the Mediterranean or to land an army in Syria.</p>

<p>The three Powers, on their part, mainly at the instance
of Lord Palmerston, declined to submit their policy to
the threats of France, and persisted in their demonstration
of force against Mehemet Ali. War was averted between
England and France, and Louis Philippe (then King of
the French) contented himself with the cynical observation
that there was all the difference in the world between
threatening war and actually going to war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the British fleet, under Admirals Stopford
and Napier, appeared before Beyrout and bombarded and
destroyed its forts. Two thousand men were landed, under
Napier, and defeated the Egyptian forces. The same
operation was repeated a few days later at Acre. The
powerful defences of this fortress were demolished by the
guns of the British fleet, and six thousand men were landed,
under Napier, and defeated Ibrahim’s army. It was in
these attacks on Beyrout and Acre that steamships made
their first appearance in maritime war. The allies were
greatly assisted by the revolt of the people of Syria against
Mehemet Ali’s oppressive government. Desertion also was
very rife in the Egyptian force, and Ibrahim’s army, which
had originally consisted of seventy-five thousand men, had
dwindled down to twenty-five thousand.</p>

<p>After these operations on the coast of Syria, Napier and
his squadron appeared before Alexandria and threatened
bombardment. But Mehemet Ali, by this time, had realized
that he could not hope to make war successfully against
the three Great Powers as well as the Sultan. He entered
into negotiations with Admiral Napier. He agreed to
evacuate Syria and to give up the Turkish fleet to the
Porte, provided that the Sultan would recognize him as
hereditary Pasha of Egypt. In the meantime the Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
of Turkey had issued a firman deposing Mehemet Ali from
all his Pashalics. This did not necessarily mean much,
for the Porte on four previous occasions had publicly
deposed the rebellious pasha, but without any result.
Eventually, on September 20, 1841, agreement was arrived
at between Mehemet Ali and the three Powers. In spite
of his deposition by the Sultan, Mehemet Ali was confirmed
in the position of hereditary Pasha of Egypt, but was
deprived of all his other governments. He was to pay
tribute to the Porte equal to one-fourth of the revenue of
Egypt—later fixed at an annual sum of £400,000. He
was to withdraw his army from Syria and to maintain no
larger force in Egypt than eighteen thousand men.</p>

<p>The intervention of the three Great Powers, taking the
matter out of the hands of the Sultan, brought about an
arrangement much more favourable to him than the Divan
were willing to agree to. Syria was relieved of the government
of Mehemet Ali and was placed again under the control
of the Porte. Egypt, on the other hand, was made practically
independent, subject only to a fixed tribute in
recognition of the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan. This
result was achieved not by the force of arms of the Sultan,
but by the action of the three Great Powers, directed chiefly
by the able diplomacy of Lord Palmerston, who steered
this concert through all its difficulties and against the
violent opposition of France. The final settlement thus
imposed on Mehemet Ali, which extinguished his ambitious
projects and reduced his rule to Egypt alone, is said to
have broken the heart of the old man. He lived on for
eight more years, but they were spent in gloom and
depression, aggravated by the death of his able and
distinguished son Ibrahim. It should be added here that
in 1841, as a sequel to the arrangement about Egypt, a
convention was agreed to between the Great Powers, including
Russia, and Turkey by which the vessels of war
of all countries except Turkey were forbidden to pass
through the Straits to and from the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The settlement of these grave questions, in 1841, was
followed by twelve years of comparative repose in Turkey,
broken only by occasional revolts of pashas, or of subject
races driven to desperation by chronic misgovernment.
These were put down by the Seraskier, Omar Pasha, who
proved to be a very competent general for this purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
It was during this period that Sir Stratford Canning, as
British Ambassador to the Porte, attained a personal influence
over the Sultan, Abdul Mehzid, of an unprecedented
character, such that he may be said to have virtually ruled
the State.</p>

<p>Canning on three previous occasions had represented
the British Government at Constantinople during the reign
of Mahmoud. In 1812 as Minister Plenipotentiary, when
quite a young man, he had gained immense credit by
inducing the Sultan to come to terms with Russia, by the
treaty of Bucharest. The effect of this was to free the
hands of the Czar and to enable him to withdraw his army
from the Danube and to use it on the flank of Napoleon’s
army in the celebrated Moscow campaign. This largely
contributed to the defeat of the invasion of Russia.</p>

<p>Later he had been engaged in the delimitation of Greece,
after the recognition of its independence, and had shown
himself a Philhellene. In 1842 Lord Aberdeen, then
Foreign Minister of England, sent him again as ambassador
to the Porte at the age of fifty-seven. He remained
there, with two short intervals, till 1858. He acquired,
during these sixteen years, the title of “The Great Elchi,”
the ambassador <i>par éminence</i>. By the Christian rayas
of the Ottoman Empire he was known as the Padishah of
the Padishahs. He was the most distinguished envoy ever
employed in the British Diplomatic Service. He belonged
to an old school of diplomats, when communications with
the Home Government were long in reaching their destination,
and when ambassadors necessarily took much responsibility
upon themselves, and dictated rather than followed
the policy of their Governments. He held himself to represent
his sovereign rather than the transient ministers of the
day. His mien was such as greatly to impress the Turks.
It was stately and dignified. His countenance was noble
and spirituelle. His eyes seemed to penetrate the minds of
those with whom he transacted business, and made it difficult
for them to conceal their intentions. His own methods
were always honourable and straightforward. Though he
was well versed in the arts of diplomacy and could meet
mine by countermine, he never resorted to trickery. The
Turks learned that his word was implicitly to be trusted,
and that he wished well to their country. He treated
the Turkish ministers with the utmost hauteur. With some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
of them, whose hands were known to be stained with
blood, he refused to have any communication. If his
demands were refused at the Porte, he went direct to the
Sultan and fairly bullied that weak, gentle, and well-intentioned
sovereign into acquiescence. He entered on
his work in this embassy with two main convictions, one
might almost say obsessions—the one that it was the interest
of England, and therefore his own duty, to oppose the
schemes of Russia at every turn; the other that it was
his duty to urge, and even to compel, the Porte to carry out
internal reforms, and to come into line with other civilized
countries in Europe, in default of which he fully recognized
that the Ottoman Empire could not be maintained. He
had a firm belief that this was possible, and that he was
himself the appointed man to effect it. For this purpose he
freely made use of threats of force from England if his
behests were refused, and of promises of protection against
Russia if they were agreed to. An envoy of this character,
great as were his qualities and personal merits, was a
cause of embarrassment to British policy, for the Government
could not control him. One might say of him, in
the words of Shakespeare:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">If great men could thunder as Jove himself does,</div>
<div class="line">Jove would ne’er be quiet.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Canning used the thunder of his country freely in
pursuance of his own policy. He was undoubtedly the
main cause of the war which soon ensued between Great
Britain and Russia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the reform of its administration and its laws
had long been recognized by the very few honest and
capable statesmen of Turkey as indispensable to the
maintenance of its Empire. Mahmoud himself, in the latter
part of his life, had appreciated this necessity, and had
given his sanction to a scheme of reform. But death came
to him before it was issued. He must have instructed his
son as to this policy, for one of the first acts of Abdul
Mehzid, by the advice of his Grand Vizier, Reschid Pasha,
was to issue the important declaration of reform which
had been prepared by Mahmoud, and was known as the
Hatti-Scheriff of Ghulkané. It promised equally to all
his subjects, without distinction of creed or race, security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of life, of honour, and of property, the equitable distribution
of taxes, the public trial of all prisoners, the right of
all to hold and devise property, and the systematic recruiting
of the army. It appointed a council to elaborate
the details of administrative reform to give effect to these
principles. But this great charter of reform lacked the
will of a Mahmoud to enforce it. There ensued a dangerous
reaction. Reschid Pasha was compelled to resign. Riza
Pasha, who succeeded him, and his colleagues, were
reactionary, fanatical, and anti-Christian. The Hatti-Scheriff,
like almost every other promise of reform
in Turkey, became a dead letter. Riza was also corrupt
and venal, and robbed the treasury of untold sums. It
became the principal object of Canning to obtain the dismissal
of this man and of the gang of peculators who
worked with him, and the reinstatement of Reschid.
Proposals for reform in favour of the rayas were impossible
with ministers who carried their hatred of Christianity to
the length of excluding from the public service every Turk
who could speak a Christian language.</p>

<p>By dint of long and patient efforts Canning obtained
such a mastery over Abdul Mehzid that he was able to
bring about a change of ministers, and to reinstate Reschid
Pasha as the only statesman in Turkey who was capable
of carrying out reforms, and who was willing to be guided
by himself as to their main principles.</p>

<p>In 1852 a serious diplomatic dispute broke out at Constantinople,
between the representatives of France and
Russia, as to the guardianship of the Holy Sepulchre at
Jerusalem and many trumpery details connected with it.
Early in 1853 there were strong indications that the
Emperor Nicholas intended to take the opportunity of this
dispute to raise a much more serious question against the
Porte. He evidently desired to disarm the opposition of
England to his schemes. In a private conversation at St.
Petersburg with Sir Hamilton Seymour, the British Ambassador
at his Court, he opened his mind:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The affairs of Turkey are in a very disorganized condition. The
country itself seems to be falling to pieces. The fall will be a great
misfortune, and it is very important that England and Russia should
come to a perfectly good understanding upon these affairs, and that
neither should take any decisive step of which the other is not apprised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>... We
have on our hands a sick man—a very sick man. It will, I tell
you frankly, be a great misfortune if one of these days he should slip
away from us before all necessary arrangements were made.</p></blockquote>

<p>With this intimation the conversation appears to have
dropped. A few days later it was renewed at a private
entertainment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You know [the Emperor said] the dreams and plans in which the
Empress Catherine was in the habit of indulging; these were handed
down to our time; but while I inherited immense territorial possessions,
I did not inherit these visions—those intentions, if you like to call them
so. On the contrary, my country is so vast, so happily circumstanced in
everything, that it would be unreasonable in me to desire more territory
or more power than I possess; on the contrary, I am the first to tell you
that our great, perhaps our only, danger is that which arises from an
extension given to an Empire already too large.</p>

<p>Close to us lies Turkey, and in our present condition nothing better for
our interests can be desired. The time has gone by when we had anything
to fear from the fanatical spirit or the military enterprise of the
Turks, and yet the country is strong enough, or has hitherto been strong
enough, to preserve its independence, and to insure respectful treatment
from other countries.</p>

<p>In that Empire there are several millions of Christians whose interests
I am called to watch over, while the right of doing so is secured to me by
treaty. I may truly say that I make a moderate and sparing use of my
right, and I will freely confess that it is one which is attended with
obligations occasionally very inconvenient; but I cannot recede from the
discharge of a distinct duty....</p>

<p>Now, Turkey has by degrees fallen into such a state of decrepitude
that, eager as we all are for the prolonged existence of his life, he may
suddenly die on our hands; we cannot resuscitate what is dead. If the
Turkish Empire falls it falls to rise no more, and I put it to you,
therefore, whether it is not better to be provided beforehand for a
contingency than to incur the chaos, confusion, and the certainty of a
European war, all of which must attend the catastrophe, if it should
occur unexpectedly and before some ulterior system has been sketched.
That is the part to which I am desiring you should call the attention of
your Government.</p>

<p>Now, I desire to speak to you as a friend, and as a gentleman. If
England and I arrive at an understanding in this matter, as regards the
rest it little matters to me. It is indifferent to me what others do or
think. Frankly, then, I tell you plainly that, if England thinks of
establishing herself one of these days at Constantinople, I will not allow
it. For my part, I am equally disposed to take the engagement not to
establish myself there—as proprietor, that is to say—for as occupier I do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>not say; it might happen that circumstances, if no previous provisions
were made, if everything should be left to chance, might place me in the
position of occupying Constantinople.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 20th February, in a further conversation, the
Emperor said:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If your Government has been led to believe that Turkey retains any
element of existence, your Government must have received incorrect
information. I repeat to you, the sick man is dying, and we can never
allow such an event to take us by surprise. We must come to some
understanding.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next day he added:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The principalities are, in fact, an independent State under my
protection. This might so continue. Serbia might receive the same
form of government. So again with Bulgaria; there seems to be no
reason why these provinces should not form one independent State. As
to Egypt, I quite understand the importance to England of that territory.
I can thus only say that if, in the event of a destruction of the Ottoman
succession upon the fall of the Empire, you should take possession of
Egypt, I shall have no objection to offer. I could say the same thing of
Candia. That island might suit you, and I do not see why it should not
become an English possession.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir Hamilton Seymour, in reply to the Emperor, said
to his Government:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I simply observed that I had always understood that the English views
upon Egypt did not go beyond the part of securing a safe and ready
communication between British India and the Mother Country.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Emperor, “induce your Government to write again
upon this subject—to write more fully and do so without hesitation. I
have confidence in the British Government. It is not an engagement or
convention which I ask of them; it is a free interchange of ideas in case
of need—the word of a gentleman—that is enough between us.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In reporting these conversations to the Foreign Secretary,
Sir Hamilton Seymour expressed his own opinion as
follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It can hardly be otherwise but that the Sovereign who insists with
such pertinacity upon the impending fall of a neighbouring State must
have settled in his own mind that the hour, if not <i>of</i> the dissolution, at
all events <i>for</i> the dissolution, must be at hand.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>In answer to these overtures the British Government,
through Lord John Russell, the Foreign Secretary, disclaimed
all intention of aiming at the acquisition either of
Constantinople or any other of the Sultan’s possessions, and
accepted the assurances of the like effect which were given
by the Czar. It combated the opinion that the extinction
of the Ottoman Empire was near at hand and deprecated
a discussion based on this supposition as leading directly
to produce the very result against which it was hoped
to provide. Finally, the British Government, with abundance
of courtesy, but in terms very stringent and clear,
peremptorily refused to enter into any kind of secret
engagement with Russia for the settlement of the Eastern
question.</p>

<p>Lord Clarendon, who succeeded Lord John Russell as
Foreign Minister in the course of these proceedings, in a
final despatch to Sir Hamilton Seymour (March 23, 1853),
expressed the following opinion:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Turkey only requires forbearance on the part of its allies, and a
determination not to press their claims in a manner humiliating to the
dignity and independence of the Sultan—that friendly support, in short,
which among States as well as individuals the weak are entitled to
expect from the strong—in order not only to prolong its existence but
to remove all cause for alarm respecting its dissolution.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be seen that the British Government took much
too sanguine a view of the prospects of reformed Government
in Turkey, and that the Emperor of Russia was much
nearer the mark.</p>

<p>We have quoted these conversations at length because
of their extreme importance when read by the light of
subsequent events. They produced a bad impression at
the time on the British Government, and still more so on
public opinion in England, when later they were made
public.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> It was thought that they indicated a deliberate
intention on the part of the Emperor of Russia to force
the Eastern question to the front, and to dismember the
Ottoman Empire by a partition of the same kind as that
to which Poland had been treated, a few years back, and
in which Russia would have the lion’s share.</p>

<p>A more reasonable view may now be taken of the
policy of the Emperor Nicholas. Subsequent events have
conclusively shown that he was fully justified in describing
the Turkish Empire as sick, almost to death, for since then
it has lost almost the whole of its dominions in Europe.
Russia also has acquired but a very small share of the vast
territories that have been taken from it. It is also subject
to the reflection that, although the British Government in
1852 disclaimed any wish or intention to join in a scheme
of partition of the Ottoman Empire, it has since acquired
a considerable part of it, approximating to the offer of
the Czar—namely Egypt, the Sudan, and the island of
Cyprus.</p>

<p>Early in 1853 the Czar sent as a special envoy to the
Porte Prince Menschikof, a rude and bluff soldier. He
was instructed to insist on Russia’s claim to the guardianship
of the Holy Sepulchre, in opposition to that of France,
and with a further demand, of a more serious kind, for a
protectorate in matters of religion over members of the
Greek Church throughout the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>It was no doubt in consequence of the conversations of
the Czar with Sir Hamilton Seymour and of this special
mission of Prince Menschikof that Canning, who had, in
1852, resigned the embassy at Constantinople, and had
been created a peer, with the title of Lord Stratford de
Redcliffe, was again sent as ambassador to the Porte by
Lord Clarendon, who was now Foreign Minister in England.
Lord Stratford himself appears to have drawn up the
instructions of the Foreign Office. He was directed to
neutralize, by England’s moral influence, the alarming
position opened up by the demands, as regards the Holy
Places and other matters, of Russia and France, and the
dictatorial, if not hostile, attitude they had assumed. He
was left unfettered for the settlement of the Holy Places.
His own judgment and discretion might be trusted to guide
him. The Porte was to be told that it had to thank
its own maladministration and the accumulated grievances
of foreign nations for the menacing tone now adopted
towards it by certain Powers; that a general revolt of
its Christian subjects might ensue; that the crisis was
one which required the utmost prudence on the part of
the Porte, and confidence in the sincerity and soundness
of the advice it would receive from him, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
resolve it favourably for its future peace and independence.
He was to counsel reform in the administration of Turkey,
by which alone the sympathy of the British nation could
be preserved.</p>

<p>In the event of imminent danger to the existence of
the Turkish Government, the ambassador was authorized
to request the admiral in command of the British fleet
at Malta to hold himself in readiness, but he was not to
direct the approach of the fleet to the Dardanelles without
positive instructions from her Majesty’s Government.</p>

<p>Lord Stratford, on arrival at Constantinople, found that
his protégé, Reschid Pasha, had been dismissed from the
post of Grand Vizier, at the instance of the new envoy of
Russia, and replaced by a pasha favourable to that Power.
Prince Menschikof, by the use of menaces, and probably
with the aid of bribes, had obtained a commanding influence
over the Sultan’s Government. He insisted that his
demands on the Porte should be kept secret, and threatened
to leave Constantinople if they were divulged to the British
Ambassador. Lord Stratford, however, found no difficulty
in obtaining full information as to the Russian demands.
He showed very great diplomatic skill in separating the
question of the Holy Places from the more serious one of the
protectorate over the Greek Church. He contrived to settle
between Russia, France, and the Porte the dispute as to
the Holy Sepulchre. There remained, however, the more
serious one of the protectorate. This was aggravated by
personal rivalry and hate between the Czar Nicholas and
Lord Stratford. The real question in dispute became largely
whether Russian or British influence was to predominate
in Turkey, and whether reforms, so essential for the security
and well-being of its Christian population, were to be carried
out under a protectorate by Russia or by England. It is
impossible to read the able biography of Lord Stratford
by Mr. Lane Poole, or Mr. Kinglake’s well-known chapters
on the causes which led to the Crimean War, without concluding
that the policy of England at this crisis was virtually
directed, not by the British Cabinet in London, but by
Lord Stratford at the Embassy at Constantinople. Prince
Menschikof, in the struggle which ensued at the Porte,
was little competent to contend against so practised and
wary a diplomat as Stratford, and was completely worsted
in the attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>Early in May, after the arrival of Stratford, a reconstruction
of the Turkish ministry was effected at his
instance. The nominee of Russia was dismissed. Ref’at
Pasha took his place as Grand Vizier, and Reschid, Lord
Stratford’s main ally, was reinstated in office as Minister
of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>By Stratford’s advice the Porte determined to resist the
Russian demands. The claim to protect the members of
the Greek Church was pronounced to be inadmissible.
Prince Menschikof was informed to this effect, and on
May 21st he broke off diplomatic relations with the Porte,
and left Constantinople in high dudgeon. This was
followed, on May 31st, by an arrogant despatch to the
Porte from the Russian Government, insisting on the
acceptance of the Menschikof demands. At the instance
of Stratford, the Porte again refused, and thereupon a
Russian army crossed the Pruth, on July 3rd, and occupied
Moldavia and Wallachia. In a manifesto, issued a few
days later, the Czar disclaimed any intention of conquest,
and justified his occupation of the provinces as a material
guarantee for the fulfilment of his demands on behalf of
the Christian population of Turkey.</p>

<p>That there was ample cause for the complaints of the
Russian Government of the maltreatment of the Christian
population in Turkey cannot be disputed. On July 22,
1853, Lord Stratford himself, in a formal communication
to the Porte, forwarded reports from the British Consuls
at Scutari, Monastir, and Prevesa, which detailed “acts
of disorder, injustice, and corruption of a very atrocious
kind, which he had frequently brought to the notice of
the Ottoman Porte.” He complained that the assurances
given by the late Grand Vizier of remedies for such evils
had not been carried out, and he observed, with extreme
disappointment and pain, the continuance of evils which
affected so deeply the welfare of the Empire.</p>

<p>Again, on July 4th of the same year, in a further
communication to the Porte, Lord Stratford wrote:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The character of disorderly and brutal outrages may be said with truth
to be in general that of Mussulman fanaticism, excited by cupidity and
hatred against the Sultan’s Christian vassals.</p>

<p>Unless some powerful means be applied without further delay, it is
to be feared that the authority of the central Government will be com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>pletely
overpowered and that the people, despairing of protection, will
augment the disorder by resorting to lawless means of self-preservation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Clarendon, the Foreign Minister, also, in a communication
to the British Ambassador, showed that he was
fully alive to the serious character of the disorders in the
Turkish Empire. He wrote:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to suppose that any true sympathy for their rulers will
be felt by the Christian subjects of the Porte, so long as they are made
to experience in all their daily transactions the inferiority of their position
as compared with that of their Mussulman fellow-subjects; so long as
they are aware that they will seek in vain for justice for wrongs done
either to their persons or their properties, because they are deemed a
degraded race, unworthy to be put into comparison with the followers
of Mahomet. Your Excellency will plainly and authoritatively state to
the Porte that this state of things cannot be longer tolerated by Christian
Powers. The Porte must decide between the maintenance of an erroneous
principle and the loss of sympathy and support of its allies.</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite, however, of the experience of the futility of
all past promises to carry out the most elementary reforms
in favour of the Christian subjects of the Porte, both
Lord Stratford and Lord Clarendon appear to have based
their policy largely on the belief that the Porte would be
more amenable in the future.</p>

<p>The occupation of the Danubian principalities by a
Russian army did not of itself necessarily involve war
with Turkey. Though the Sultan was suzerain of these
provinces, they enjoyed complete autonomy under the protection
of Russia. Under certain conditions that Power
was entitled to send its army there. But the continued
occupation of them was clearly antagonistic to the sovereign
rights of the Sultan and would ultimately lead to war.</p>

<p>With a view to avoid war, a conference was held by the
representatives of all the Powers except Russia at Vienna,
and an agreement was arrived at for the settlement of the
question between Russia and Turkey by England, France,
Austria, and Prussia. This was agreed to by Russia. It
was commended to the Porte by the Powers, and Lord
Stratford was instructed by Lord Clarendon to use all
his efforts to obtain its consent.</p>

<p>Officially, Lord Stratford performed his task in due
accord with the instructions of Lord Clarendon. But his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
biographer and, still more, Mr. Kinglake admit that the
rejection of the Vienna demand was mainly due to the
British Ambassador. After quoting the words of Lord
Stratford, in which he described his efforts to induce the
Porte to accede to it, Kinglake writes:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These were dutiful words. But it is not to be believed that, even
if he strove to do so, Lord Stratford could hide his real thoughts from the
Turkish ministers. There was that in his very presence which disclosed
his volition; for if the thin, disciplined lips moved in obedience to constituted
authorities, men who knew how to read the meaning of his brow,
and the light which kindled beneath, could gather that the ambassador’s
thoughts concerning the Home Governments of the four Great Powers of
Europe were little else than an angry <i>quos ego</i>; the sagacious Turks would
look more to the great signs than to the terms of formal advice sent out
from London, and if they saw that Lord Stratford was, in his heart,
against the opinion of Europe, they could easily resolve to follow his
known desire and to disobey his mere words. The result was that
without any sign of painful doubt the Turkish Government determined
to stand firm.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the view of a panegyrist of Lord Stratford.
We have quoted it for the purpose of showing that it was
practically Lord Stratford who guided the Turkish Government
in this matter.</p>

<p>After the failure of the settlement prepared at the Vienna
Conference, the Porte, on October 1st, by the advice of
Lord Stratford, made a formal demand on Russia for the
evacuation of the Danubian principalities, and in default of
this, a fortnight later it declared war. The Turks then
boldly took the initiative. Their army, under Omar Pasha,
crossed the Danube in November, 1853, and fought two
battles successfully against the Russians at Oltenitza and
Citale in Wallachia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on October 22nd, when Russia and Turkey
were already at war, the fleets of England and France
entered the Dardanelles. Though this was not an infraction
of the treaty of 1841, it was a distinctly hostile act on the
part of these Powers against Russia. But negotiations still
continued. Whatever hopes, however, there were of a
favourable issue were destroyed when, on November 30th,
a Russian fleet of six battleships, issuing from Sebastopol,
attacked and completely destroyed a Turkish squadron of
eleven cruisers and smaller vessels lying at anchor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
port of Sinope, on the coast of Asia Minor. Four thousand
Turkish sailors perished in this engagement. This was
an act of war, as legitimate as the attack by the Ottoman
army on the Russian force north of the Danube, the more
so as the Turkish vessels were believed to be carrying
munitions of war to arm the Circassians against Russia.
It caused, however, an immense sensation in England and
France. It was denounced as an act of treachery and as
a massacre rather than a legitimate naval action. The
fleets of the two Powers then lying in the Bosphorus were
at once instructed to enter the Black Sea and to invite any
Russian ships of war they might meet there to return to
their ports. They were to prevent any further attack on
Turkey. This made war inevitable. But negotiations were
still for a time continued, and it was not till March 28,
1854, that war was actually declared against Russia by
England and France. Armies were then sent by these
Powers to Constantinople, and thence to Varna, in the Black
Sea, with the object of protecting Turkey against the attack
of a Russian army and of assisting the former in compelling
the evacuation by the Russians of the two Danubian
provinces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, early in the spring of this year (1854), a
Russian army had crossed the Danube and had invested
Silistria, the great fortress which barred the way to the
Balkans and Constantinople. It was defended with the
utmost bravery and tenacity by a Turkish army under
Moussa Pasha, assisted by two British engineer officers,
Butler and Nasmyth. On June 25th the Russians recognized
that they could not capture the fortress. They
raised the siege and retreated across the Danube, after
incurring immense loss of life and material.</p>

<p>All danger of an advance by the Russians across the
Danube and the Balkans was now at an end. The Turks
unaided had effectually prevented any such project. The
Russian army thereupon retreated from the Danubian principalities.
Their place there was taken by an Austrian
army, with the consent of both Russia and the two Western
Powers. No reason existed, therefore, why the war
should be continued, so far as England and France were
concerned. There was no longer any necessity for their
armies to defend the frontiers of Turkey. But a war spirit
had been roused in the two countries and was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
allayed without much shedding of blood. The two Powers
decided to use their armies which had been collected at
Varna for the invasion of the Crimea and the destruction of
the naval arsenal at Sebastopol, which was regarded as a
permanent menace to Turkey.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, the part of the Turks in the war became
subordinate and even insignificant. The war was fought
<i>à outrance</i> between the two allied Powers and Russia.
The successful landing of the two armies at Eupatoria, in
the Crimea, their splendid victory over the Russian army
at the Alma, their flank march to the south of Sebastopol,
the commencement of the long siege of that fortress, the
famous battles of Balaklava and Inkerman and the terrible
sufferings of the British army in the winter of 1854-5, the
memorable defence of Sebastopol under General Todleben,
the capture of the Malakoff by the French on September 8th,
1855, and the consequent evacuation of the city and forts of
Sebastopol, on the southern side of its great harbour, are
events of the deepest interest in the histories of the allied
Powers and Russia, but have comparatively little bearing
on our present theme. Very little use was, in fact, made
of the Turkish army by the Allies in the course of the war.
A division of seven thousand men was sent to the Crimea
in the autumn of 1854, and was employed for the defence
of Balaklava. It was led by most incompetent officers, and
when attacked by the Russians on the morning of the Battle
of Balaklava, the men precipitately fled. This exposed the
flank of the allied army to great danger. Later, another
Turkish force under Omar Pasha was sent to Eupatoria. It
was attacked there by a much superior Russian army, early
in 1855, and fighting behind earthworks it made a very
effective resistance and completely repulsed the Russians.
It was said that the humiliation of this defeat of his troops
by the despised Turks was the immediate cause of the
death of the Emperor Nicholas.</p>

<p>In Asia Minor another Russian army invaded Turkish
territory and laid siege to the fortress of Kars. There
followed the memorable defence of this stronghold by the
Turks, assisted, if not commanded, by General Williams,
later Sir Fenwick Williams, and Colonel Teesdale. It was
ultimately, after a four months’ siege, compelled by want
of food and munitions to capitulate. The failure to relieve
it was due to the grossest and most culpable negligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
of the Turkish Government. In this siege and in that of
Silistria and the defence of Eupatoria, the Turkish soldiers
gave ample proof that when well led they had lost none of
their pristine valour in defence of earthworks. The allied
Powers, however, seem to have been quite ignorant or
unmindful of the military value of the Turkish soldiers and
made little or no practical use of them. An army of
fifty thousand Turks led by English or French officers
would have been of the utmost value in the earlier part
of the war. It was only towards the close of it that twenty
thousand Turks were enrolled under British officers. But
this action was too late, and they took no part in the war.</p>

<p>The writer, as a young man, spent a month in the Crimea
in 1855, and was present as a spectator on Cathcart’s
Hill on the eventful day when the Malakoff was captured
by the French, and the British were repulsed in their attack
on the Redan. He well recollects the prevalent opinion
among British officers, whom he met, that the Turkish army
was a negligible force and of no military value in the
field. This opinion was abundantly shown in the attitude
of British and French soldiers to the Turkish soldiers whenever
they met, and must have been very galling to the
pride and self-respect of the latter.</p>

<p>The capture of the Malakoff, a great feat of arms on the
part of the French army, was the last important event in
the campaign of 1855. Early in 1856 there were strong
indications that the Emperor of the French was weary of
the war. Public opinion in France declared itself unmistakably
against its continuance. France had nothing to
gain by its prolongation. Its military pride had been
satisfied by success in the capture of Sebastopol and the
destruction of the Russian fleet. Its army in the Crimea
was suffering severely from disease. With the British it
was otherwise. Their army before the enemy was in greater
force than at any previous period of the war. It was eager
to retrieve its prestige, which had been somewhat impaired
by the failure at the Redan. The British Government was
as anxious for another campaign as was the army. But
without their French ally they could obviously do nothing.
The French Emperor entered into secret negotiations with
the Emperor Alexander, who had succeeded Nicholas. The
success of the Russian army in the capture of Kars and
the valour it had shown in defence of Sebastopol made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
easy to negotiate peace without slur on its military fame.
It is impossible for us, who now look back on these times,
to perceive what possible object could have been gained
by England in prolonging the war. The projects of completing
the conquest of the Crimea, and of sending an army
to the Caucasus in aid of the Circassians, and another army
to the Baltic to free Finland from Russia, were fantastic
and perilous. England was saved from these adventures
by the wiser policy of the French. The British Government
against its will was compelled to enter into a negotiation
for peace. This was effected through the mediation
of Austria. Terms were provisionally agreed to, and a
Congress of the Great Powers was held in Paris in 1856,
at which a treaty of peace was finally concluded.</p>

<p>Under the terms of this treaty all the territories conquered
by Russia in Asia or by the allied Powers in
Europe were restored to their former owners. The small
part of Bessarabia conceded to Russia by the treaty of
Bucharest and giving access to the Danube was reannexed
to Moldavia. The exclusive protectorate of Russia over
the two Danubian principalities was abolished, and they
were placed under the joint protection of all the Great
Powers. The suzerainty of the Sultan over them was
recognized. But the Porte engaged to preserve for them
an independent and national administration, with full liberty
of worship, of legislation, and of commerce. They were
to be permitted to organize national armed forces. Serbia
was accorded the same treatment, except as regards a
national army, but the armed intervention of the Porte was
to be permitted only with the consent of the Powers who
were signatories to the treaty. The Black Sea was
neutralized. It was thrown open to the mercantile marine
of all nations, but was interdicted to the war vessels of
either Russia or Turkey, and these two Powers engaged
not to establish or maintain any military maritime arsenals
on its coasts.</p>

<p>As regards the internal administration of Turkey and
the treatment of its Christian population, the treaty contained
the following clause:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Sultan, having by his constant solicitude for the welfare of his
subjects issued a firman (the Hatti-Humayun), which, while ameliorating
their condition without distinction of religion or race, records his generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>intentions towards the Christian population of his Empire, and wishing
to give a further proof of his sentiments in that direction, has resolved
to communicate to the contracting Powers the said firman emanating
spontaneously from his sovereign will. The contracting Powers recognize
the high value of this communication. It is clearly understood that it
cannot give to the said Powers the right to interfere either collectively
or individually in the relations of H.M. the Sultan with his subjects or in
the internal administration of his Empire.</p></blockquote>

<p>The latter part of the clause, it will be seen, completely
nullified and destroyed the effect of the earlier part of
it, and practically gave full licence to the Sultan to continue
his misgovernment of his Empire and to refuse the
just demands of his Christian subjects—a very lame and
impotent conclusion to the war.</p>

<p>In explanation of this clause, it should be stated that
Lord Stratford, shortly before the meeting of the Congress,
had succeeded, after long efforts, in extracting from
the Porte another charter of reform in favour of its Christian
subjects, known as the Hatti-Humayun. This was referred
to in the treaty, not as an act binding on the Porte, but
merely as an indication of the Sultan’s good intentions,
and with the express condition that neither the Great Powers
signatories to the treaty nor any one of them were to be
entitled to call him to account in the event of his pious
intentions not being carried into effect. Lord Stratford,
when he heard at Constantinople of the intentions of the
Congress, but before a final conclusion was arrived at,
wrote to Lord Clarendon the following strong protest:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are many able and experienced men in this country who
view with alarm the supposed intention of the Conference at Paris to
record the Sultan’s late Firman of Privileges (the Hatti-Humayun) in the
treaty of peace, and at the same time to declare that the Powers of Europe
disclaim all right of interference between the Sultan and his subjects.
They argue thus: The Imperial firman places the Christians and the Mussulmans
on an equal footing as to civil rights. It is believed that the Porte
will never of its own accord carry the provisions of the firman seriously
into effect. The treaty, in its supposed form, would therefore confirm
the right and extinguish the hope of the Christians. Despair on their
side and fear on that of the Turks would, in that case, engender the
bitterest animosity between them, and not improbably bring on a deadly
struggle before long.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>
<p>This protest, which doubtless represented Lord Stratford’s
own convictions, was of no avail. Lord Clarendon
was powerless at the Congress. He met with no support
from the French representatives. They cared nothing for
reforms in Turkey. The Russians, in view of the origin
of the war and the refusal of the other Powers to recognize
their claim to intervention on behalf of the Christians in
Turkey, were naturally indisposed to concede it to others,
either individually or collectively. The nullifying provision
was inserted in the treaty. It abrogated whatever effect the
recognition of the firman might have had. The Hatti-Humayun
became, <i>ipso facto</i>, a dead letter. Lord Stratford
was bitterly disappointed. “He felt very keenly,”
says his biographer, “the pusillanimity of his own Government,
who had made him a victim to their deference to
France.” In a letter to his brother after the conclusion of
the treaty, Lord Stratford wrote: “To be the victim of so
much trickery and dupery and charlatanism is no small
trial. But I have faith in principles as working out their
own justification, and fix my thoughts steadily on that
coming day when the peace of Paris will be felt and its
miserable consequences.”</p>

<p>Lord Clarendon, in a letter to the ambassador, thus
described his own views of the treaty:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think as you do about the terms of peace, but I am not the least sorry
that peace is made, because, notwithstanding our means of carrying on
the war, I believe we should have run risks by so doing for which no
possible success would have compensated. We should have been alone....
If you could have seen all that was passing when I got to Paris—the
bitterness of feeling against us, the kindly (I might almost say the
enthusiastic) feeling towards Russia, and the determination, if necessary,
to throw over the Vienna conditions in order to prevent the resumption
of hostilities (money matters and Bourse speculations being the main
cause), you would have felt as I did, that our position was not agreeable,
and that Brunnow was justified in saying that they did not come to
make or negotiate peace, but to accept the peace which was to be crammed
down their throats.... Unluckily, too, just as negotiations began the
French army fell ill, and the Emperor himself admitted to me that, with
twenty-two thousand men in hospital and likely to be more, peace had
almost become a military as well as a financial and political necessity
for him.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Stratford’s words on hearing that the treaty was
signed were, “I would rather have cut off my right hand
than have signed that treaty.”</p>

<p>The writer paid a second visit to Constantinople in 1857.
He rode there from Belgrade, passing through Bulgaria
on the way, and was witness of the miserable condition to
which this province had been reduced by Ottoman rule.
He spent a few weeks at Therapia, where the Ambassador
was residing, and was favoured by many conversations with
him. Lord Stratford was always most kind and communicative
to young men. He made no secret of his bitter disappointment.
The treaty of Paris, he alleged, was a death-blow
to the cause of reform in Turkey. If the Christian
population were not protected from misgovernment, the
Empire was doomed. He was under no illusion as to the
misgovernment of the country. He knew that if left to
themselves the Turks would do nothing, and that all the
reforms promised by the Hatti-Humayun which he had
obtained with so much labour and difficulty before the conclusion
of the Crimean War would remain unexecuted and
would be a dead letter. He considered that England had
been betrayed at the Congress of Paris, that the clause in
the treaty which embodied the Hatti-Humayun was nullified
by the provision that its recognition did not entitle the
Great Powers either collectively or separately to interfere
in the internal affairs of Turkey. He held that this was
fatal to the enforcement of the new reforms. He maintained
that the only way to induce the Turks to act in
accordance with them was through threats and fear, and
that some external Power should bring such pressure to
bear on them. This might be done by England alone, or
by England in alliance with France, or by the Great Powers
collectively. He preferred the first of these; he had
little hope of the last; but the treaty had extinguished all
methods equally.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> It was the last year of the Great Elchi’s
reign at Constantinople. He retired from his post and
from the public service in the following year at the age
of seventy-one.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Sir Henry Bulwer, later Lord
Dalling, an ambassador of a very different type. Though
an able diplomat, he cared nothing for reform in Turkey.
He allowed himself to be placed under personal obliga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>tion
to the Sultan, which destroyed his influence. He
made no effort to induce, still less to compel, the Porte
to give effect to the Hatti-Humayun which his predecessor
had obtained with so much labour.</p>

<p>The cause of reform in Turkey [says Mr. Lane Poole], for which Lord
Stratford had striven for so many years, began its downward course when
the Turks understood the altered character of the British Embassy under
Sir Henry Bulwer. Lord Stratford’s farewell to Constantinople was the
occasion for a stately ceremony, in which the Sultan and all his ministers
and the whole population joined in paying a last tribute to the departing
Elchi.... He knew, however, that he was assisting in the obsequies of
his hopes. His long struggle for reform of the Ottoman Empire was
at an end, and in the character of his successor he could trace the
antithesis of all he had striven for, the abandonment of all he had won.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Stratford lived on in retirement to the age of
ninety-three, long enough to see the verification of all
his fears as to the effect of the unfortunate clause in the
treaty of Paris in nullifying the promises of reforms in
Turkey and of all his predictions as to the result of this in
the revolt in 1874 of the Christian populations of Bosnia,
Herzegovina, and Bulgaria under the stress of appalling
misgovernment and tyranny, and in their final liberation
from Turkish rule by the armies of Russia. On this occasion
the revolt of these subjects of the Porte had his full
sympathy, and he admitted that Russia was fully justified in
its intervention.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone in 1876 dedicated to Lord Stratford his
pamphlet on Bulgarian atrocities, which had such a powerful
effect in preventing England from taking up arms again
in support of Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Looking back at the Crimean War, it is now possible
for us to perceive and admit that its main, if not its only,
result was to postpone for a few years the break up of the
Turkish Empire in Europe. It negatived for a time the
claim of Russia to an exclusive protectorate over the
Christian populations of the Balkans which would secure
to them the benefit of good government. Lord Stratford’s
hopes of a reformed Turkish Empire, more or less under
the ægis of England, were frustrated by the treaty of
Paris. As a result, no reforms were effected in Turkey.
Its downward course was retarded, but not averted. When,
in 1876, the accumulated grievances of the Christian population
compelled an outbreak, it will be seen that the
intervention of Russia on their behalf was practically
admitted by England and the other Great Powers.</p>

<p>Abdul Mehzid died in 1861. He had not realized even
the small promise of his youth. He had many instincts that
were sound and good. He was the most humane of the
long list of Sultans. He fully recognized the urgent necessity
for reforms in his State, in order to bring it into line
with other civilized States in Europe. But he had not
the energy or the will to carry them into effect, and the programme
of reform conceded to Lord Stratford remained a
dead letter. He was prematurely aged by debauchery. He
was the first Sultan to fall into the hands of moneylenders of
Western Europe. Great sums were borrowed ostensibly
for the war with Russia. But the larger part of them
was expended by Abdul Mehzid in wild extravagance,
in gratifying the caprices of the multitude of women in
his harem, in building palaces, and in satisfying the
demands of corrupt ministers. On the occasion of the
marriage of one of his daughters with the son of a Grand
Vizier he spent forty millions of francs on her trousseau
and in fêtes. Meanwhile the services of the State were
neglected, nothing was done to relieve Kars, and corruption
spread in all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>
<p>Abdul Aziz, who succeeded his brother and reigned for
fifteen years, was physically one of the finest of his race.
He was majestic in appearance. His mien was gracious.
He was every inch a Sultan. But this was about all that
could be said for him. His mind was vacuous. His
education had been neglected. He had spent many years
in forced seclusion, but had secretly intrigued with the
more fanatical party in the State against his brother, and
had raised hopes that on coming to the throne he would
reverse the measures of reform, such as they were, which
his two predecessors had initiated. But he belied these
expectations for a time. On his accession he issued a
proclamation announcing his intention to follow his two
predecessors in the path of reform. He promised to
economize the resources of the State and to reduce the
vast expenditure of the palace. He pensioned off the
multitudes of concubines of his brother, and gave out
that he meant to content himself with the most modest
harem. But these proved to be no more than good intentions,
which only paved the way to very opposite measures.
Before long his own retinue of women was increased to
nine hundred, and the number of eunuchs in his palace
to three thousand. His extravagance soon emulated that
of his brother. His reign was one of external peace,
which afforded full opportunity for giving effect to the
reforms promised by his brother and registered by the
treaty of Paris. Nothing was ever done. The firman
proved to be a dead letter. His ministers cared no more
than himself for reforms. Successive British Ambassadors
made no serious efforts in this direction. Indeed, they
were precluded by the treaty of Paris from any exclusive
pressure on the Porte, without the support of all the other
Powers.</p>

<p>The reign was chiefly conspicuous for the enormous
borrowings of money in London and Paris by the Porte,
following on the bad example set by Abdul Mehzid. The
debt was rapidly increased by Abdul Aziz till it reached
a total of nearly two hundred millions sterling. It does
not appear that the accruing interest on this great debt
was ever paid out of the revenues of the Empire. Fresh
loans were continually raised, out of which the accumulated
interest on previous loans was provided. Huge commissions
to financiers who brought out the loans, and bribes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
pashas for consenting to their issue, accounted for another
large part of the borrowed money. What remained was
mainly devoted by the Sultan to new palaces and to
extravagances of his harem. This merry game went on
as long as credulous people in Western Europe could be
induced to continue lending. But the credit of the Turkish
Empire was exhausted in 1874. A repudiation of half
of the interest was then announced, and in the following
year the remaining half was repudiated. This did much
to weaken the interest of Western Europe in the Turkish
cause. Eventually a composition was arrived at with the
creditors of the State. An International Commission was
appointed, in whom certain revenues of the State were
vested, out of which the interest of a greatly reduced total
of the original debt was to be paid. The principle of foreign
control over the finance of the Empire was thus
introduced.</p>

<p>The Russian Government during this reign, by its skilful
diplomacy, backed by threats of force, recovered much of
its old influence at the Porte, and its ambassador, General
Ignatief, began to dominate its councils and to nominate
its Grand Viziers. Three events during the period showed
the gradual downward course of the Empire. In 1867 the
two Danubian principalities succeeded in accomplishing
their long-desired object of uniting together in a single
State, thenceforth known as Roumania; and in 1868 Prince
Charles of Hohenzollern was elected, and was invested by
the Sultan as the hereditary ruler of this new State. The
union of the two provinces into a single State practically
secured independence to it, while the connection of its
ruler with the reigning family of Prussia marked the advent
of that Power into the political system of the Christian
States founded on the débris of the Turkish Empire in
Europe, and was the first of many important alliances of
which we now see the intent and result. Serbia also made
an important advance to independence. In 1867 the Turkish
garrison in Belgrade, the occupation of which had been
confirmed by the treaty of Paris, was withdrawn by the
Porte. These two events were the result of pressure of
the ambassadors of the Great Powers, who were anxious
to minimize the causes of friction to the Porte, which did
not add to its real strength.</p>

<p>Another important event was the repudiation by Russia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
on October 31, 1870, during the Franco-German War, of
the clause in the treaty of Paris of 1856 which interdicted
the Black Sea to Russian and Turkish vessels of war,
and forbade to both Powers the creation or maintenance of
naval arsenals on the coasts of that sea. We now know that
Prince Bismarck, on behalf of Prussia, secured the neutrality
of Russia in the war with France, in 1870, by promising
to support this repudiation by the Czar of his treaty
obligation. Complaint has not unfrequently been made of
the refusal or neglect of the British Government, of which
Mr. Gladstone was then the head, to insist on the maintenance
of this treaty by Russia, even at the risk of war.
But the Porte, in whose interest the provision had been
framed by the Congress of Paris, and which was primarily
concerned in its maintenance, showed no desire or intention
to make its breach by Russia a <i>casus belli</i>, and it
would have been sheer madness for England, either with
or without Turkey, to have taken up the challenge of
the Czar. A humiliating restriction such as this on the
sovereign rights of a great country was obviously of a temporary
character, and could not, in the nature of things, be
a permanent arrangement. It had served its purpose by
giving to the Porte a respite of fourteen years from naval
attack by Russia. Lord Palmerston, who was Prime
Minister in England when the treaty was made, had himself
put on record the opinion that the enforced neutrality
of the Black Sea might be expected to last for fifteen
years. It is to be noted that some years would necessarily
elapse after the repudiation of the treaty before a Russian
fleet could be created in the Black Sea and before Sebastopol
could be restored as a naval base. In point of fact,
in the war, which was soon to break out between Russia
and Turkey, in 1877, the latter Power had virtual command
of the Black Sea, and the Russian army which crossed
the Balkans and advanced to the vicinity of Constantinople
did so without the support of a naval force in the
Black Sea, as had been the case in 1829.</p>

<p>Another event also occurred in 1870, the significance of
which was not fully appreciated at the time. Previous to
that year the Christian Slav populations of the Balkans,
such as the Bulgarians, Bosnians, and others, were under
the spiritual jurisdiction of the Greek Ecumenical Patriarch
and were regarded as Greeks. The ancient history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Bulgaria and its claims to a distinct nationality appear to
have been forgotten or ignored by politicians interested in
the Eastern question. On March 10, 1870, Abdul Aziz,
under pressure from Russia, backed by its able ambassador,
General Ignatief, issued a firman recognizing the
separate existence of Bulgaria, and creating for it a national
Church independent of the Greek Church, though differing
in no important respect in point of doctrine or ritual.
This laid the foundation for a new nationality in the
Balkans. Bulgaria, long forgotten, emerged from obscurity
and came to the front as a competitor of the Greeks.
The importance of this will be appreciated later, when we
come to the rivalry of these races for the débris of the
Ottoman Empire in Europe.</p>

<p>In 1876 a bloodless revolution took place in Constantinople.
A new ministry was forced upon Abdul Aziz, of
which Midhat Pasha—one of the few genuine and convinced
reformers among the leading Turks—was a member.
They decided to depose the Sultan. They obtained a
<i>fetva</i> from the Mufti justifying this on the ground of his
incapacity and extravagance. No single hand was raised
in his favour. After a vain protest, he submitted to his
fate, and was removed from his palace to another building
destined to be his prison. Four days later he was found
dead there, and nineteen physicians of the city, including
men of all nationalities, testified that Abdul Aziz died by
his own hand.</p>

<h2><small>XXI</small><br /><br />

ABDUL HAMID II<br />

<small>1876-1909</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the deposition of Abdul Aziz, his nephew, the eldest
son of Abdul Mehzid, much against his will, was proclaimed
as Sultan, under the title of Murad V. His feeble
mind, reduced to a nullity by long seclusion in the Cage,
and by the habit of intemperance, was completely unhinged
by this unexpected elevation, and after a few weeks—on
August 31, 1876—it became necessary for the committee
of ministers who had set him on the throne to depose him
in favour of the next heir. His brother, Abdul Hamid II,
held the Sultanate for thirty-three years, and is still alive,
in the custody of another brother, the present Sultan, after
being deposed, in his turn, in 1909.</p>

<p>Abdul Hamid proved to be the most mean, cunning, untrustworthy,
and cruel intriguer of the long dynasty of
Othman. His mother was an Armenian. He was destitute
of physical courage. He lived in constant fear of plots
and assassination, and in suspicion of every one about
him. He trusted no one, least of all his ministers. He
allowed no consultations between them. If he heard that
two of them had met in private, his suspicions were aroused
and they were called to account. He employed a huge
army of spies, who reported to him directly and daily as
to the doings of his ministers, of the ambassadors, and of
any one else of importance. They fed him with reports,
often false, on which he founded his actions. Plots were
invented in order to induce him to consent to measures
which otherwise he would not have sanctioned. He
claimed and exercised the right of secret assassination of
his foes or suspected foes. No natives of Turkey were
safe. They might disappear at any moment, as so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
thousands had done by the order of the Sultan, through
some secret agent, either to death or exile. This was not so
much from pure wickedness of heart as from fear of being
assassinated himself, and the belief that his safety lay in
exterminating his enemies before they had the chance of
maturing their plans against himself. The ambassadors of
foreign Powers had little influence with him, except so
far as they were able to threaten the use of armed force,
when, sooner than risk war, he gave way. He showed great
cunning in playing off one ambassador against another,
and was an adept in all the meanest intrigues of diplomacy.</p>

<p>Abdul Hamid’s life was one of incessant labour. He
devoted himself most assiduously to the work of his great
office. Whatever his demerits, he was absolute master of
his ministers and of his State. There never was a more
centralized and meticulous despotism. As he trusted no
one, he was overwhelmed by most trivial details and graver
questions were neglected. He could not, indeed, administer
the vast affairs of his Empire without information or advice
from others, but no one knew from day to day who was
the person on whose advice the Sultan overruled his ostensible
ministers, whether a favourite lady of his harem, or a
eunuch, or some fanatical dervish, or an astrologer, or a
spy. There was constant confusion in the State, arising
from antagonism between the officials of the Porte and
the minions of the palace.</p>

<p>Outwardly, Abdul Hamid had the manners of a gentleman,
but inwardly he was as mean a villain as could be
found in the purlieus of his capital. He was avaricious to
an extreme, and though his expenditure was most lavish and
his charities wide, he amassed immense wealth, which he
invested secretly through German bankers against the rainy
day which he expected. When it came and he was deposed,
amid universal execration and loathing, his life was spared
in the hope mainly of extracting from him these secret
investments. He was not above receiving bribes himself,
on a great scale, from financiers in search of concessions.
He did nothing to check the chief evil of Turkish rule—the
sale of offices and the necessity for officials to recoup
themselves for their outlay by local exactions. Though
he was not without some instincts for good government,
and was free from any fanaticism, his system was such
that everything went to the bad in his reign, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
many years of peace, after the treaty of Berlin, were
attended by no improvement in the condition of his people,
but the reverse. The result of his policy was that his
Empire suffered a greater dismemberment than had been
the bad fortune of any of his predecessors, and as he
monopolized power, he must be held mainly responsible
for its evil results.</p>

<p>At the very outset of his reign Abdul Hamid was confronted
with most serious questions affecting the integrity
of his Empire. In 1875 an outbreak had occurred in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, the result not merely of misgovernment
by the Turkish pashas and officials, their rapacity and
exactions, and of the system of farming the taxes, but
of a vicious agrarian system. The great majority of
landowners, though of the same Slav race as the rayas,
the cultivators of the soil, were Moslems by religion. Their
forbears had become so when the Ottomans conquered
their State in order to save their property. They were
as rapacious and fanatical as any landowners of Turkish
race in any part of the Empire. No Christians were
employed in the administration of these provinces. The
evidence of the Christian rayas was not admitted in the
courts of law. Justice or injustice could only be obtained
by bribes. The police and other officials lived by
extorting money from those whom it was their duty to
defend.</p>

<p>The bad harvest of 1874 was the immediate cause of
the outbreak, for the farmers of the taxes refused to make
any concessions. It was, in the first instance, directed
rather against the Moslem landowners and the local Turkish
officials than against the Sultan, but it rapidly developed
into a general insurrection against the Sultan’s government.
Every effort was made by Austria and Russia to localize
it and to induce the Porte to make concessions. Count
Andrassy, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, drew up
a scheme for the pacification of the two provinces. It
proposed that the system of farming the taxes should be
abolished, that the taxes raised in the provinces should
be expended locally for their benefit, that complete religious
equality should be established, and that a mixed commission
should be appointed to supervise the carrying out of
these reforms. The scheme was agreed to by Russia, Great
Britain, and the other Powers, and was presented to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Sultan, who acquiesced in it. But it proved, like other
promises of reform in Turkey, to be a dead letter. Not a
single step was taken to give effect to any part of it. The
rebellion in the two provinces continued. The insurgents
increased their demands. They insisted that one-third of the
land should be given up to the rayas. The movement soon
extended to Bulgaria, which was seething with disaffection.</p>

<p>On April 21, 1876, an outbreak of Bulgarians occurred
on the southern slopes of the Rhodope Mountains, of which
Batak was the centre. It was put down without difficulty
by a small Turkish force sent from Constantinople, under
Achmet Agha, with little loss of life to the troops engaged,
but with relentless cruelty, not only to the actual insurgents
who surrendered on promise of life, but to the whole population
of the district. Bands of Bashi-Bazouks, consisting
of Tartars from the Crimea who had been planted in
Bulgaria, were let loose on them. Indiscriminate murders,
rapes, and rapine took place. Sixty villages were burnt.
Twelve hundred persons, mostly women and children, took
refuge in a church at Batak and were there burnt alive.
In all about twelve thousand persons perished in these
brutal reprisals. Achmet Agha received a high decoration
from the Sultan for this performance. There was
nothing new in this method of dealing with an outbreak
by the Porte. It was in accord with its traditional system
and policy to wreak vengeance on those revolting by orgies
of cruelty, which would strike terror among subject races
and act as a warning to them in the future.</p>

<p>What was new in the case of the Bulgarians in 1876,
and was fraught with misfortune to the Turkish cause,
was that full and graphic accounts of the horrors committed
at Batak, written by Mr. Edwin Pears (now Sir
Edwin), the correspondent at Constantinople of the <i>Daily
News</i>, appeared in the columns of that paper. They produced
a profound impression on public opinion in England.
Discredit was thrown on the story in the House of Commons
by Mr. Disraeli, the Prime Minister, but it was fully confirmed
by Mr. MacGahan, another correspondent of the
same paper, who visited the district, and later by Mr.
Walter Baring, a member of the British Embassy at Constantinople,
who, by the direction of the Government, made
full personal inquiries on the spot. He described what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
had taken place as “perhaps the most heinous crime that
has stained the history of the present century.”</p>

<p>It was also unfortunate for the Turks that Mr. Gladstone,
the only survivor in the House of Commons of the British
statesmen responsible for the Crimean War, who had
recently retired from the leadership of the Liberal party, was
fired by the description of these horrors in Bulgaria to
emerge from his retirement and to take up the cause of
the Christian population of European Turkey, for which
he held that the treaty of Paris had made his country
responsible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the horrors at Batak had also aroused the
indignation of Russia and the fears of Austria. A
fanatical outbreak of Moslems at Salonika resulted in the
murder of the Consuls of France and Germany. Serbia
and Montenegro, impelled by sympathy for their fellow
Slavs in Bosnia, declared war against Turkey. A Turkish
force defeated the Serbians, who appealed to Russia
for assistance. At this stage another effort was made
by Russia and Austria, supported by Germany, to avert
a general conflagration, and a scheme was embodied
in what was known as the Berlin Memorandum for compelling
the Porte to carry out the reforms which it had
admitted to be necessary. The British Government, however,
very curtly refused to be a party to the scheme, on
the ground that they had not been consulted in framing
it and did not believe in its success. About this time
also the British fleet in the Mediterranean was ordered to
Besika Bay, a step taken avowedly for the purpose of
protecting British subjects in the turmoil which had arisen,
but which seemed to the Porte to indicate an intention to
support them against the demands of the other Powers.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, fearing that these actions indicated the
intention of the British Government to withdraw from the
concert of Europe and to renew the separate policy which
had led to the Crimean War, made a vehement attack on
it in the House of Commons for refusing to agree to the
Berlin Memorandum. Later, in September 1876, he published
his well-known pamphlet on “the Bulgarian
Horrors,” in which, with passionate language, he dwelt
at length on the massacres at Batak and denounced the
Turkish Government. He protested that he could no longer
bear his share of responsibility for the Crimean War.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Otherwise he might be accused of “moral complicity in
the basest and blackest outrages upon record in that
century.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those [he wrote] who opposed the Crimean War are especially
bound to remember that the treaty of Paris made Europe as a whole,
and not Russia alone, responsible for the integrity and independence
of the Ottoman Empire, which had given this licence to Turkish officers
to rob, murder, and ravish in Bulgaria.... As an old servant of the
Crown and State, I entreat my countrymen, upon whom far more
than perhaps any other people of Europe it depends, to require and
insist that our Government, which has been working in one direction,
shall work in the other, and shall apply all its vigour, in common with the
other States of Europe, in obtaining the extinction of the Turkish executive
power in Bulgaria. Let the Turks now carry away their abuses in the
only possible manner, namely, by carrying off themselves. Their zapties
and their mudirs, their bimbashis and their yuzbashis, their kaimakans
and their pashas, one and all, bag and baggage, shall, I hope, clear out
from the province they have desolated and profaned.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The pamphlet produced an immediate and profound
effect on public opinion in Great Britain. It was followed
up by speeches of the same force and eloquence on the
part of the veteran statesman. Meetings took place in
every part of the country, at which sympathy was expressed
for the Christian populations of Turkey. The Turks were
denounced for their cruelties and bad government. Resolutions
were unanimously passed in accord with the policy
recommended by Mr. Gladstone. Lord Stratford himself
expressed sympathy with the movement, differing only in
this from Mr. Gladstone, that England, in his view, should
exert its influence not only for the Bulgarians, but for all
the oppressed subject races in Turkey. Many of the most
cultivated men in England joined in the movement quite
irrespective of party politics.</p>

<p>Mr. Disraeli, who was created Earl of Beaconsfield in
the course of these events, on his retirement from the
House of Commons, showed great courage and persistence
in resisting the movement. His sympathies lay wholly in
the opposite direction. His Eastern policy was in accord
with that of the previous generation of statesmen, such
as Palmerston, and, indeed, Gladstone himself in his earlier
stage of opinion, who believed that the maintenance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>Turkish Empire was essential to the integrity of the British
Empire. He saw no reason for change. He dreaded the
further advance of Russia. He did not believe in the
honesty of the professions of its Emperor. He enforced
his views at a public meeting at Aylesbury on September
20th, and endeavoured to stem the movement. He
scoffed at the Bulgarian horrors. He declared the perpetrators
of them were not so bad as those who made them
the subject of agitation for their political purposes. He
was evidently prepared to support the Turks against any
invasion of their country by Russia, and to renew the policy
of the Crimean War. But it was in vain.</p>

<p>Though the agitation promoted by Mr. Gladstone did
not result in inducing the Government to join the other
Powers in compelling the Turkish Government to concede
autonomy to its Christian provinces, or to carry out reforms,
it had two effects of great historical importance, which
must be our justification for referring to the subject. It
made impossible the renewal of the policy of the Crimean
War—the armed support by Great Britain to the Turks
against an invasion by Russia on behalf of the Christian
population of the Balkans. It paralysed the hands of those,
like Lord Beaconsfield, who desired to support the Turks
and the <i>status quo</i>. On the other hand, it doubtless stimulated
Russia to armed intervention, by making it clear that
there would be no resistance on the part of Great Britain.
Lord Beaconsfield’s Cabinet was divided on the subject.
A majority of its members evidently concurred with Lord
Derby, the Foreign Secretary, in opposition to war with
Russia on behalf of Turkey.</p>

<p>On September 21st, the day after Lord Beaconsfield
had delivered his fiery pro-Turkish speech at Aylesbury,
Lord Derby, on behalf of the Government, in a despatch
to the Ambassador at Constantinople, directed him to
inform the Porte that the atrocious crimes of the Turkish
authorities and troops in Bulgaria had aroused the righteous
indignation of the British people, and that Great Britain,
as signatory to the treaty of Paris, could not be indifferent
to them. He demanded that examples should be made
of the perpetrators of these crimes.</p>

<p>On October 30th Lord Derby further informed the Russian
Government, through the ambassador at St. Petersburg,
that, however strong the feeling in England against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Turkish cruelties, it would be superseded by a very different
sentiment if it were believed that Constantinople was
threatened, or that British interests in the Suez Canal were
in any danger. This message to the Emperor could only
be interpreted as meaning that the British Government
would not interfere with any action that Russia might take
against Turkey, provided it did not involve the conquest
of Constantinople or endanger British interests in Egypt.
It was evidently so understood by the Emperor, for immediately
on receipt of the above despatch, on November 2nd,
he gave his word of honour to the British Ambassador
that he had no designs on Constantinople and no intentions
whatever to annex Bulgaria.</p>

<p>In spite of this explicit announcement on the part of
the Emperor, in response to the despatch from the British
Foreign Minister, Lord Beaconsfield, a few days later, on
November 9th, at the annual civic banquet at the Guildhall
of London, delivered himself of a most bellicose speech
on behalf of Turkey, practically threatening war with
Russia, without any reference to the pacific assurance of
the Czar, which, as we now know, was in his hands at the
time when he made this speech. There could not well
be a clearer intimation on the part of the British Premier
that he had no belief in the good faith of the Emperor.</p>

<p>This menacing speech of the British Prime Minister
was telegraphed to Russia, with the result that the Czar
was greatly incensed, and on the next day, November 10th,
he made a public pronouncement at Moscow to his people
of the gravest importance, to the effect that, if he could
not obtain adequate guarantees from the Porte for the
protection of its Christian subjects, he would act independently
of other Powers, relying on the loyalty of his
people to support him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, through Lord Derby’s efforts, it had
been arranged with Russia and the other Great Powers
that a Conference should be held at Constantinople of representatives
of all the Powers, for the purpose of deciding
what administrative changes should be proposed to the
Sultan, with a view to the common purpose—namely the
better protection of his Christian subjects in Europe.</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury, as a member of the British Cabinet and
Secretary of State for India, represented England at this
Conference. It met at Constantinople on December 23,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
1876. On the day before the meeting of the Conference
at Constantinople a firman was published by the Sultan, at
the instance of Midhat Pasha, promulgating a scheme of
constitutional reform, which had been agreed to by the
ministers of the Porte in the short reign of Murad, but
which Abdul Hamid on his accession had refused to
sanction. A National Assembly was convoked, to be elected
by universal suffrage, without distinction of race or
religion, throughout the Empire. It was hoped to anticipate
the demands of the Conference by a scheme of reform
wider than they were likely to advise. This was effected
with perfect good faith by Midhat, who was earnestly in
favour of reform. But subsequent events showed that the
Sultan adopted this course for the purpose only of throwing
dust in the eyes of the Conference, and with the full
intention of setting aside the Constitution as soon as the
Conference had broken up. The Conference might perhaps
have acted more wisely in treating this act of the Sultan
as an honest proposal, and in making it the basis of a wide
reform of the Ottoman Empire. They held it to be a
sham. They proceeded with their discussions as if it had
not been issued. They preferred an alternative scheme
of providing autonomous institutions for the Christian
provinces of Turkey, and for the appointment of governors
subject to the approval of the Great Powers. There was
practically no difference of opinion at the Conference
between the British and Russian delegates, Lord Salisbury
and General Ignatief. The Conference, at their instance,
reduced its demands on the Porte to the most moderate
minimum.</p>

<p>The Sultan refused point-blank to entertain the proposals
of the Conference, on the ground that they interfered
with his sovereign powers. He pleaded the new
Constitution which he had just accorded to the Empire.
There never was any intention on his part to make any
concessions. He was under the belief that if war resulted
with Russia from his refusal to agree to reforms his country
would not stand alone. He took the policy of England
from the speech of Lord Beaconsfield at the Guildhall;
and not from Lord Derby or Lord Salisbury. Lord
Beaconsfield had, in fact, thrown over his colleague, Lord
Salisbury, in that unfortunate utterance and had insured
the failure of the Conference at Constantinople.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after the break-up of the Conference, Midhat
Pasha was ignominiously dismissed from office. The new
Constitution did not long survive its author. In May,
1877, Abdul Hamid suspended it and dismissed the National
Assembly which had been convoked. During the two months
of its existence its members had shown a determination to
expose the scandalous abuses of the Hamidian system. Later
Abdul Hamid trumped up a charge against Midhat of having
been responsible for the murder of Sultan Aziz. Two men
employed by that Sultan, a wrestler and a gardener, were
suborned to confess that they strangled Aziz at the instance
of Midhat. Midhat was tried by corrupt judges and was not
allowed to cross-examine these men. He was found guilty
and condemned to death. At the instance mainly of the
British Government the sentence was commuted to banishment
to Arabia. Midhat was there strangled by order of
Abdul Hamid in 1882, and his embalmed head was sent to
Constantinople, in order that the Sultan might be assured of
his death. The two men who had confessed to the murder
of Aziz were released and were pensioned by the Sultan. Sir
Henry Elliot, who was British Ambassador at Constantinople
at the time of the death of Sultan Aziz, put on record his
conviction that it was a case of suicide, that the charge
against Midhat was trumped up, and that the whole proceedings
are an indelible stain on Abdul Hamid.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1877, another attempt was made by the
Great Powers to effect a settlement of the Eastern question.
Count Schouvaloff was sent to London by the Emperor of
Russia on a special mission for the purpose. Agreement
was arrived at between the Powers. It was embodied in a
protocol, and was presented to the Porte. It was promptly
rejected on April 10th by the Sultan as inconsistent with
the treaty of Paris by interfering with the independence
of the Ottoman Empire. Russia thereupon declared war
against Turkey, justifying it in a dignified manifesto, on
the ground that the Sultan, by rejecting the protocol, had
defied Europe. Russia, therefore, held the strong position
of acting on behalf of Europe. England was the only
Power to take exception to this. Lord Derby, in a
despatch to the Russian Government, said that he and his
colleagues regarded the action of Russia as an obstacle to
reform in Turkey, and held that the plight of the Christian
population could not be improved by war—a most unfor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>tunate
prediction, as the result proved. More fortunate
was the prediction of Mr. Gladstone at the close of a
speech which he made in the House of Commons, on April
24, 1877, immediately after the declaration of war by
Russia, when moving a resolution intended to prevent the
Government from taking up a hostile attitude to Russia
in the coming war.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I believe, for one [he said], that the knell of Turkish tyranny in these
provinces (the Balkan provinces) has sounded. So far as human eyes
can judge, it is about to be destroyed. The destruction may not come
in the way or by the means that we should choose; but come from what
hands it may, I am persuaded that it will be accepted as a boon by
Christendom and the world.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The answer of the Government to Mr. Gladstone was
given in the debate by the Home Secretary, Sir Richard
Cross, later Lord Cross. It showed that the policy of
Lord Derby, and not that of Lord Beaconsfield, had prevailed
in the Cabinet. The Government, he said, regretted
the war which had been declared by Russia, and did not
believe that it would do any good, but it would not give
support to either side, unless the Suez Canal or Egypt or
Constantinople were threatened.</p>

<p>It followed from this decision of the British Cabinet
that the hopes which the Sultan had formed from the
speeches of Lord Beaconsfield were not realized. He was
left alone to fight against Russia in another attack on his
Empire. Immediately after the declaration of war, on April
24, 1877, two Russian armies invaded Turkey—the one in
Europe, of two hundred and fifty thousand men, under the
nominal command of the Grand Duke Nicholas, the other in
Asia, of a hundred and fifty thousand men from the Caucasus,
under that of the Grand Duke Michael. The former crossed
the Pruth into Roumania, which was still nominally a part
of the Ottoman Empire. But on April 15th the Roumanian
Chamber had given its assent to a convention with Russia
providing for the passage of the Russian troops through
the principality and otherwise giving promise of friendly
support. The Porte, as was to be expected, treated this
as a hostile act, and directed the bombardment of Calafat,
a Roumanian fortress on the Danube. The Roumanians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>thereupon, on May 21st, declared war against Turkey. They
gave most effective support to the Russians throughout the
campaign. Indeed, it may be fairly said from the course
of the campaign that the invasion of Bulgaria would not
have been successful without the help of the Roumanians.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Russia had further prepared the way
for the invasion of Turkey by securing the neutrality of
Austria-Hungary. At a personal meeting in the previous
year at Reichstadt, he had assured the Emperor of Austria
that he had no intention of taking possession of Constantinople.
He further promised that Bosnia and Herzegovina
would be handed over for occupation by Austria-Hungary
as a reward for neutrality in the event of success
in his war against the Turks.</p>

<p>Owing to unprecedented inundations in the valley of
the Danube, it was not till two months after the commencement
of the campaign that the Russian army was able to
cross that river. It did so at two points, the one in the
Dobrudscha, the other at Hirsova. In neither case did it
meet with serious opposition. The Turkish army of defence
was little inferior in numbers to that of the Russians, but
its general, Abdul Kerim, proved to be quite incompetent.
He spread his forces in detachments over a front of five
hundred miles, and was too late in concentrating them.
The Russians, after capturing Nicopolis, the Turkish stronghold
on the Danube, advanced into Bulgaria and captured
Tirnovo, its ancient capital. Everywhere they were received
by the Bulgarians with rapturous demonstrations of delight
at the prospect of deliverance from Ottoman rule.</p>

<p>General Gourko, with a flying corps, then made a very
hazardous but successful march across the Balkans by the
Hainköi Pass, and advanced into Bulgaria along the Trudja
Valley as far as Eski Zagra. Thence, turning back, he
attacked the more important Shipka Pass from the south,
and defeated a Turkish force in occupation of it. Meanwhile,
early in July, the main Russian army from Tirnovo
came in contact at Plevna, twenty miles south of the Danube,
with a Turkish army of fifty thousand men under Osman
Pasha, who had been sent in relief of Nicopolis, but was
too late for the purpose.</p>

<p>Plevna was not a fortress. It was a strong natural
position, where the Turks entrenched their army behind
earthworks and redoubts with great engineering skill, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
where they maintained an obstinate and memorable defence
for nearly five months, the most striking incident of the
campaign of 1877. Three unsuccessful assaults were made
by the Russians, assisted by a Roumanian army, in which
great losses were incurred. Thereupon, by the advice of
General Todleben, the hero of the defence of Sebastopol
in the Crimean War, the attempt to take these works at
Plevna by assault was given up, and it was subjected to a
close investment. The occupation of the Shipka Pass by
Gourko prevented the advance of a Turkish army in relief
of Plevna, in spite of successive attacks by the Turkish army
under Suleiman Pasha. As a result, after five months of
heroic resistance, Osman Pasha found himself in great straits
for want of food for his army. He determined to make a
great effort to break through the lines of the investing
army. The sortie failed, and Osman and his whole remaining
army of thirty-two thousand men were compelled to
surrender on January 9, 1878. This had the effect of
releasing the Russian army in front of Plevna. General
Gourko and the main part of the Russian army thereupon
marched to Sofia. General Skobeleff, in command of
another army, determined to force his way across the Balkan
range. An army of ninety thousand Turks under another
Pasha was stationed at the southern end of the Shipka
Pass and barred his way. Directing a part of his army to
make a feint attack along the Shipka Pass, Skobeleff led
the remainder by two sheep tracks distant about six miles
from the pass, and crossing the mountains, was able to attack
the enemy on the flank at Shenova. The Turks were
defeated and their whole army was compelled to surrender.
By this brilliant manœuvre of Skobeleff, the Grand Duke
Nicholas, in nominal command of the whole Russian army,
was able to advance without further opposition to Adrianople.
He took possession of it on January 28th. Meanwhile
the Turks met with further defeats from the Serbians
and Montenegrins. The former captured the important
town of Nisch. The latter captured Spizza, in the bay of
Antivari, and Dulcigno, in the Adriatic.</p>

<p>In Asia the Turks were no more fortunate than in Europe.
Their army under Muktar Pasha was little inferior in
numbers to that of the Russians, but it was divided between
Kars, Ardahan, and Erzerum. The Russians in the course
of the campaign of 1877 succeeded in successively cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>turing
these important fortresses and in getting possession
of nearly the whole of the districts inhabited by Armenians.</p>

<p>By the middle of January 1878 the resistance of the
Turks was practically at an end in both continents. They
were compelled to sue for peace and to appeal for the
mediation of the other Powers of Europe. On January 31st
an armistice was agreed on.</p>

<p>The capture of Adrianople and the fact that there was
no Turkish army capable of resisting the further advance
of the Russians to Constantinople caused great alarm to
the British Government. Opinion in England, which had
not supported Lord Beaconsfield in his desire to renew the
policy of the Crimean War, and to assist the Turks against
the invasion of Bulgaria by the Russians, now veered round,
at least among the wealthier and a large section of the
middle class, and declared itself vehemently opposed to
the occupation of Constantinople, which appeared to be
imminent, even if it should be only of a temporary
character.</p>

<p>The British fleet at Besika Bay was ordered to enter the
Dardanelles. The House of Commons was asked to vote
six millions for war purposes. Every preparation was
made for war. Russia replied to these demonstrations by
advancing its army nearer to Constantinople. The headquarters
of the Grand Duke Nicholas were established at
San Stefano, a village on the shore of the Marmora, within
sight of Constantinople. A portion of the British fleet then
took up a position near to Prince’s Island, also within sight
of the capital. The position between the two countries,
England and Russia, was therefore most critical.</p>

<p>Meanwhile negotiations took place directly between Russia
and the Porte. Terms of peace were offered and agreed to,
and on March 3, 1878, a treaty was signed between the
two Powers at San Stefano. It was in accord with the
promises which had been made to the British Government
by the Czar. Constantinople, the province of Thrace, and
Adrianople were left in possession of the Turks, and the
capital was not even to be temporarily occupied by the
Russian army. Bulgaria was not to become a Russian
province or even an independent State. But a great Bulgaria
from the Danube southward, with frontiers on the
Black Sea and the Ægean Sea, and including the greater
part of Thrace, was constituted as an autonomous State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
subject to the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan, under a
prince to be elected by its people and approved by Russia.
As thus constituted, it would cut off the Porte from direct
junction and communication by land with its remaining
possessions in the Balkan peninsula, such as Macedonia,
Epirus, and Albania. Serbia and Montenegro were to be
greatly enlarged and both were to be independent States.
Bosnia and Herzegovina were to be endowed with autonomous
institutions while remaining subject to the Porte.
Reformed administration was to be secured for the remaining
Balkan provinces. No extension was conceded to Greece,
but Thessaly, Epirus, and Crete were included in the provision
of reformed administration. The Roumanians were
very shabbily treated after the valuable assistance they had
rendered to the Russian army. The part of Bessarabia, inhabited
largely by Roumanians, which had been taken from
Russia by the treaty of Paris and added to Moldavia, was to
be restored to the Czar, together with a small strip which
brought Russia up to the Danube as a riverain State. In
exchange, Roumania was to be content with the barren
Dobrudscha, sparsely inhabited by Bulgarians and Turks.
Roumania was to be an independent State. In Asia, Kars,
Ardahan, Bayezid, and Batoum, and their districts were to
be ceded to Russia. Erzerum was to be restored to
Turkey. An indemnity for the war of twelve millions
sterling was to be paid by Turkey.</p>

<p>The publication of these terms did not allay the apprehensions
of the British Government. They were regarded,
in the first instance, as meaning the complete dismemberment
of Turkey in Europe. Lord Beaconsfield and the
Turkophil members of the Government believed that a
great Bulgaria would be completely under the influence of
Russia, and would be used as a stepping-stone for the
ultimate acquisition of Constantinople by that Power. They
could not understand, what was often insisted upon by Mr.
Gladstone in his speeches, that the best barrier against
the advance of Russia, in the Balkan peninsula, would be
a self-governing, contented, and prosperous State, and that
the larger it was the better it would serve that purpose. The
Government, under these misapprehensions, determined to
resist the creation of a big Bulgaria, even at the risk of
war with Russia. They maintained that the treaty of San
Stefano was completely at variance with the treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Paris of 1856, and must be revised by a new Congress of
the great Powers of Europe.</p>

<p>The Russian Government would not agree to submit
the whole treaty to a Congress, but only some parts of it.
A collision between Russia and England seemed to be
imminent. War preparations were continued by the latter,
and Indian troops were sent to Malta. Lord Derby, the
Foreign Minister, and Lord Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary,
who were opposed to war, resigned, and the war party
in the Cabinet prevailed. But the Czar was very averse to
war, whatever might be the wishes of his generals at the
front before Constantinople. At the last moment terms
of reference to a Congress were agreed upon between the
two Governments, and war was averted. By an agreement
which was intended to be secret, but which was divulged
to the Press in England by an unscrupulous employé at the
Foreign Office, the British Government promised to support,
at the Congress, the main clauses of the treaty of San
Stefano, subject to a concession, on the part of Russia, as
to Bulgaria. Under this agreement, the intended big Bulgaria
was divided into three parts. That between the
Danube and the Balkan range was to be dealt with as
proposed in the San Stefano treaty. It was to be an
autonomous State under the suzerainty of the Sultan, with
a prince elected by its people. A second part of it, immediately
south of the Balkan range, to be called Eastern
Roumelia, was to be an autonomous province more directly
under the control of the Porte. A third, the part bordering
on the Ægean Sea and containing a mixed population of
Bulgarians, Serbians, Greeks, and (in parts) Moslems, was to
be restored to the Porte subject to conditions for better administration
equally with other Turkish provinces in Europe.
This part has since been generally spoken of as Macedonia.</p>

<p>The Congress of the Powers met at Berlin on June 13,
1878, under the presidency of Prince Bismarck. It was
the most important gathering of the kind since the Congress
of Vienna in 1815. The Great Powers were represented
by their leading statesmen. England, by Lord Beaconsfield
and Lord Salisbury; Russia, by Prince Gortchakoff
and Count Schouvaloff; France, by its Prime Minister,
Waddington; Italy, by Count Corti, its Foreign Minister;
Austria, by Count Andrassy. The Porte, apparently, was
unable to find a competent Turk for the purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
It was represented by Karatheodori, a Greek, and by
Mehemet Ali, a renegade German. Germany, it need not
be said, was represented by Bismarck, who acted as the
‘honest broker.’ Although apparently invested with unlimited
authority to deal with all questions arising out of
the treaty of San Stefano, the Congress found that its hands
were practically tied behind its back by the agreement
between England and Russia. It had no other option than
to cut down the big Bulgaria under the tripartite scheme
already described, which was the essence of the Anglo-Russian
agreement. As regards the artificially created
province of Eastern Roumelia, Lord Beaconsfield, who
throughout the proceedings of the Congress championed
the Turkish cause, insisted that the Porte was to have the
right to maintain garrisons in its frontier fortresses. He
threatened to break up the Congress if this was not conceded.
Russia, though strongly opposed to this, ultimately
gave way. This was a triumph for Beaconsfield, the value
of which we can now appreciate, with the knowledge that
no advantage was ever taken by the Porte of this permission
to garrison Eastern Roumelia.</p>

<p>The most important point on which the Congress effected
a change in the treaty of San Stefano was in respect of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the instance of Bismarck,
these two provinces, instead of being endowed with
autonomous government, were handed over to Austria for
occupation and administration, while remaining nominally
a part of the Turkish Empire. Montenegro was to lose
half of the territory conceded to it at San Stefano.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> The
claims of Greece for a definite extension of its territory
were championed by the representative of France, but were
opposed by Lord Beaconsfield. The Congress contented
itself with a recommendation to the Sultan that the
boundaries of Greece should be extended so as to include
Thessaly and a part of Epirus. Organic reforms of administration
and law were to be carried out by the Porte in the
European provinces of the Empire on the recommendation
of a Commission to be appointed by the Great Powers.</p>

<p>The Congress confirmed to Russia the acquisition of
the provinces in Asia above referred to, and the restoration
of Erzerum and Bayezid to the Porte. The Armenians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>were guaranteed good government and protection from the
raids of Kurds and Circassians. Some other amendments
of the San Stefano treaty of no great importance were
decided upon, and on July 13, 1878, the treaty of Berlin
was signed by the representatives of all the Powers, after
exactly a month of discussion.</p>

<p>After his success at the Congress in respect of the
Roumelian garrisons, obtained by the threat of war,
Beaconsfield was able to return to England with a flourish
of trumpets, boasting that he had succeeded in obtaining
‘peace with honour.’ Though the treaty of Berlin nullified
that of San Stefano as regards the big Bulgaria, it did,
in fact, ratify the virtual dismemberment of the Ottoman
Empire in respect of four-fifths of its territory in Europe
and freed about eight millions of people from its rule. This
great achievement was due to Russia alone, and the gains
to that Power in Bessarabia and Armenia were in comparison
small and unimportant. The splitting up of
Bulgaria, which constituted the main difference between
the two treaties, was due to British diplomacy, backed by
threats of war. But the result obtained did not stand the
test of even a short experience. Two of the Bulgarian
provinces thus torn asunder were reunited seven years later.
More recently, the parts of Macedonia and Thrace restored
to full Turkish rule by the treaty of Berlin have, within
the present century, again been freed from it, and have
been annexed to Serbia and Greece in about equal portion.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this brief statement that by the treaty
of Berlin Great Britain obtained nothing for itself, unless
it were that the division of Bulgaria was of permanent
value to it in strengthening the hold of the Turks on
Constantinople, a contention which has not been confirmed
by subsequent events. It did, however, succeed in getting
something out of the general scramble for territory. By
another secret treaty which, to the amazement of the
members of the Congress at Berlin, was made public during
their sittings, the Porte agreed to hand over to the occupation
of England the island of Cyprus, on terms very
similar to those under which Bosnia and Herzegovina were
placed under the charge of Austria. The occupation of
the island was limited to the time during which Kars and
Ardahan should be in possession of Russia. As a condition
of this occupation, Great Britain guaranteed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Porte its Asiatic possessions. But this guarantee was conditional
on good government being secured to the Armenian
population in the east of Asia Minor, a condition which
has never, in fact, been fulfilled. The treaty was justified
in the British Parliament on the ground that Cyprus would
be of great value as a <i>place d’armes</i> for the British
army in the event of attack by Russia on the Asiatic
provinces of Turkey or of an attack from any quarter
on Egypt. The Porte was guaranteed by the British
Government an annual tribute so long as the occupation
should last, based on the average revenue which it had
received from the island. The proceeds were assigned
for payment of the interest on the loan raised by Turkey
during the Crimean War, guaranteed by England and
France. The arrangement was made hastily and without
due inquiry, with the result that the island has been
burthened with a charge far in excess of its past payments
to the Porte, and the British taxpayers have been
compelled to bear a part of the burthen. An occupation
such as that of Cyprus was almost certain to become permanent,
and in 1914, during the existing war, the island
was permanently annexed by the British Government.</p>

<p>Looking back at the events which led to the liberation
of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule and to all the other changes
sanctioned by the treaty of Berlin, it must now be fully
admitted that the agitation which Mr. Gladstone promoted
against the Turkish Government had a great ultimate effect.
It averted the use of armed force by Great Britain for
the purpose of preventing the intervention of Russia on
behalf of the Christian population of the Balkans. In a
great speech in the House of Commons in review of the
treaty of Berlin, Mr. Gladstone delivered himself of this
verdict on it:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Taking the whole provisions of the treaty of Berlin together, I must
thankfully and joyfully acknowledge that great results have been achieved
in the diminution of human misery and towards the establishment of
human happiness and prosperity in the East.</p></blockquote>

<p>As regards the conduct of England at the Congress he
added these weighty words:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I say, Sir, that in this Congress of the Great Powers the voice of
England has not been heard in unison with the constitution, the history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>and the character of England. On every question that arose, and that
became a subject of serious contest in the Congress, or that could lead to
any practical results, a voice has been heard from Lord Beaconsfield and
Lord Salisbury which sounded in the tones of Metternich, and not in the
tones of Mr. Canning, or of Lord Palmerston, or of Lord Russell....
I do affirm that it was their part to take the side of liberty, and I do also
affirm that, as a matter of fact, they took the side of servitude.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Salisbury himself lived to make the admission that
England in its Eastern policy “put its money on the
wrong horse.”</p>

<p>The three years which followed the treaty of Berlin
were spent by the Great Powers in the endeavour to give
effect to its provisions, by settling the boundaries between
Turkey and its <i>disjecta membra</i>, and other important details.
Two of these questions led to great difficulty. The Porte,
as was to be expected, put every obstruction in the way
and resorted to its accustomed dilatory methods. By the
treaty Montenegro had been guaranteed a port in the
Adriatic. It was not till 1880, after the return of Mr.
Gladstone to power in England, that effective pressure was
put on the Porte. He induced the other Powers to join
in sending a combined fleet to the Adriatic to blockade
its coast as a demonstration against the Porte. This, however,
was not effective for the purpose. It mattered little
to the Porte that its coast in the Adriatic was blockaded.
It was not till the British Government threatened to send
its fleet to Asia Minor, and by seizing some custom houses
there to cut off supplies of money, that the Sultan was
brought to book. Eventually the port of Dulcigno and
the district round it were ceded to Montenegro and its
claim for access to the Adriatic was conceded.</p>

<p>The case of Greece caused even greater difficulty. The
treaty of Berlin, it has been shown, contained no specific
promise or guarantee of a cession of territory to Greece. It
merely made a recommendation to that effect, leaving it to
the discretion of the Porte whether to accede to it or not.
As Greece had taken no part in the war of liberation of
the Balkans, it had no special claim, except such as
arose from a wish of the Powers to avoid complications in
the future. It was admitted, however, by the Porte that
something should be done in the way of rectifying its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>frontier in this direction. Another conference of the Powers
at Berlin reported in favour of drawing the frontier line
so as to include in the kingdom of Greece the whole of
both Thessaly and Epirus. This was gladly assented to by
Greece, but was rejected by the Sultan. The Powers,
however, were not willing to back up their proposals by
armed force. The French Government, which had supported
the claim of Greece at the Congress, now drew
back. Eventually, after two years of diplomatic labour,
a compromise was arrived at, mainly at the instance of
the British Ambassador to the Porte, Mr. Goschen, who
showed infinite skill and patience in dealing with the Sultan.
A line of frontier was agreed to, which conceded to Greece
the whole of Thessaly and about a third part of Epirus.
This line excluded Janina and other districts inhabited
by Moslem Albanians, and also other districts where Greeks
predominated, but under the circumstances it was the most
which could be effected without a resort to arms. Greece
had to wait some years before a more complete settlement
could be secured to her.</p>

<p>As regards the organic local reforms in administration
and law which, under the treaty of Berlin, were to be carried
out in the European provinces of the Empire, a Commission
was appointed by the Great Powers in 1880. The British
representative was Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice, later Lord
Fitzmaurice. He took the leading part in drawing up a large
and complete scheme of reform, which was agreed to by
the Commission and was presented to the Sultan for his
approval in accordance with the treaty.</p>

<p>There followed, after these proceedings, a period of
twenty-eight years, up to 1908, during which Turkey, under
the rule of Abdul Hamid, was free from external war, and
opportunity was therefore afforded for giving effect to the
promises by the Porte, guaranteed by the treaty of Berlin,
of reforms and improved administration in Macedonia and
other Balkan provinces left in its possession, and also
in Crete and Armenia. Except as regards Crete, not
a single step, however, was ever taken by the Porte to
give effect to these promises. The scheme of organic
reform was never approved by the Sultan. It was treated
as waste-paper, like every other promise of reform in
Turkey. Disorder and misgovernment continued unabated.</p>

<p>Several events soon took place which showed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
disintegration of the Ottoman Empire was still slowly but
surely proceeding. The most important of these was in
relation to Bulgaria. The reduced and mutilated province
under that name, as settled by the treaty of Berlin, chose
as its ruler, with the consent of the Powers, Prince
Alexander of Battenberg, a young man of great merit
and promise. Eastern Roumelia, cut off from Bulgaria,
was also constituted as a separate province, more immediately
dependent on the Porte, but with autonomous
government, under a Christian governor nominated by the
Sultan. But this ingenious scheme of Lord Beaconsfield
did not work in practice. Economic difficulties, arising
from separate tariffs, equally with national aspirations,
necessitated union. The representative chambers of both
provinces were incessant in their demands for this.</p>

<p>The union of the two States was now opposed by Russia.
But, strange to say, it was supported by Great Britain,
at the instance of Lord Salisbury, who had been associated
with Lord Beaconsfield at the Congress of Berlin in insisting
on the severance of the two provinces. He had
since been persuaded by the British Ambassador at Constantinople,
Sir William White, a far-seeing statesman who
had intimate knowledge of the Balkans, that a united
and strong Bulgaria would, in the future, be a bar
to the ambitions of Russia against what remained of
Turkey.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Bulgarians, the Sultan arrived
at the same conclusion. When, therefore, in 1885, the
two provinces insisted on union, and a Bulgarian army
occupied Eastern Roumelia, with the full assent of its population,
who deported the Turkish governor to Constantinople,
the Sultan made no real opposition. He was
persuaded to accept the union as a <i>fait accompli</i>. The
diplomatic difficulty arising out of the treaty of Berlin
was evaded by the Sultan in 1886 nominating the Prince of
Bulgaria as governor of Roumelia. Thenceforth the representative
chambers of the two States met as one body at
Sofia, and the union was practically effected. This caused
great discontent in Serbia, which was jealous of the
aggrandizement of its neighbour and demanded territorial
compensation. War consequently broke out between Serbia
and Bulgaria. After a three days’ battle at Slivnitza, the
Bulgarians, contrary to all expectations, were completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
successful, under the able generalship of Prince Alexander.
Belgrade lay open to the victorious army. But the Great
Powers then again intervened and insisted on terms of
peace between the belligerents, based upon the <i>status quo</i>
before the war. The Emperor of Russia deeply resented
the action of his relative, Prince Alexander. The Prince
was kidnapped and was forcibly conveyed out of the
country and compelled to abdicate. There ensued a strong
movement in his favour in Bulgaria. He was recalled
from exile. But at this critical moment of his career the
Prince appears to have lost his nerve, and instead of standing
firm and relying on the support of the people, for
whom he had done so much, he gave way to the demands
of the Czar, and retired into obscurity as a cavalry officer
in the Austrian army. In his place Prince Ferdinand of
Saxe-Coburg was elected as ruler of the united province,
subject to the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan.</p>

<p>Another cause of frequent international difficulty during
the reign of Abdul Hamid was that of the island of Crete.
The Powers at Berlin had refused to include it in the
kingdom of Greece or even to recommend this course to
the Porte. They contented themselves with a provision in
the treaty guaranteeing to the island a reformed administration
under a Christian governor. In compliance with this,
Photiades Pasha, a Greek subject of the Porte of administrative
capacity, was appointed governor, and a representative
chamber was constituted. For a few years the island
enjoyed peace and prosperity. But later, on the retirement
of Photiades, the Sultan endeavoured to restore his authority
in the island by appointing a Moslem governor and suspending
the national assembly. Insurrection followed in
1896. The Greeks of the island, who formed by far the
greater number of its inhabitants, were supported by the
Government and people of Greece. War broke out in
1897 between the Porte and Greece. It was the first
occasion on which the Turkish army, which had been
trained by German officers, under command of General
von der Goltz, was able to show its quality. In thirty
days it completely defeated the Greek army and occupied
Thessaly and Epirus. The Powers thereupon intervened
and prevented the Porte from taking advantage of its
success. Peace was again insisted upon between the
belligerents. Greece was compelled to submit to a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
rectification of its frontier and to pay the cost of the war,
estimated at four millions sterling.</p>

<p>The Turks thereupon evacuated Thessaly, and with them
departed the last of the Moslem beys or landowners.
Though Greece had at the time a navy superior in strength
to that of the Porte, it effected nothing in the war by sea.
Turkish troops had been able to invade Crete, and were in
practical occupation of it. The four Powers, not including
Germany, whose Kaiser was already coquetting with the
Sultan, with a view to a future military alliance, then
blockaded the island, occupied ports on its coast, and ultimately
compelled the Turkish troops to evacuate it. In
1898 Prince George of Greece, a son of the King of
Greece, was appointed governor of the island at the
suggestion of the Powers, and the native assembly was
recalled into existence. This arrangement was obviously of
a temporary nature. It lasted with growing friction till the
revolution in Turkey in 1908. When Austria annexed
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Cretan Assembly proclaimed
annexation to Greece, and thenceforth the union of the
island to the present kingdom was complete and was fully
recognized by the Powers.</p>

<p>The Great Powers were less successful in securing
performance of the promises of the Sultan under the treaty
of Berlin in the case of the Armenians. The Porte had
undertaken by the treaty to carry out, without delay, “the
amelioration and reforms demanded for provinces inhabited
by Armenians and to guarantee their security against Kurds
and Circassians.” Periodic reports showing what reforms
were effected were to be laid before the Powers, who
were also to superintend their application. These provisions
were the more important as they were practically
the conditions on which the provinces of Erzerum and
Bayezid, which had been occupied by the Russians in their
invasion of the Asiatic provinces of Turkey in 1877, were
restored to the Porte. It may be taken that, if the Powers
had conceived it possible that these promises would not
be carried out, they would not have been so cruel as to
restore these two provinces, inhabited so largely by
Armenians, to Turkish rule. Lord Salisbury in 1888 did,
in fact, use strong language to the Porte on the subject
of Armenia, and threatened armed force if reforms were
not carried out. In spite of this threat, no reforms were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
effected. Mr. Gladstone, when he came into power again
in 1892, endeavoured to bring pressure on the Porte in
favour of the Armenians, but he met with no support from
other Powers. Bismarck at last intimated to him that the
subject had better be allowed to drop. Russia, it seems,
was at that time engaged in the effort to induce the
Armenians inhabiting the districts round Kars, which had
been ceded to it under the treaty of Berlin, to give up their
national Church and to join the Greek Church. It was
little disposed to give support to the Armenians who
remained subjects of the Porte.</p>

<p>As a result, the Armenians obtained no valid protection,
and the Kurds and Circassians continued their raids against
these peaceful people. Later, suspicion of Armenian insurrection
arose in the mind of Sultan Abdul Hamid. There
were a few isolated cases in which insignificant numbers
of Armenians, prompted by their compatriots across the
frontier in Russia, formed conspiracies against the Turkish
Government. But these feeble sparks were extinguished
by the Turkish officials on the spot without difficulty. They
were made the excuse, however, by the Sultan for a new
policy of massacre directed against these unfortunate
people. Massacres on a small scale began in 1889.</p>

<p>In 1890, when the writer was at Constantinople, he was
favoured with an interview by the Sultan, who spoke on
the subject of the Armenians, and sent a message to Mr.
Gladstone, conveying his most positive assurances that he
was animated by none but the most friendly feelings towards
these people, and that he was determined to secure to
them good government. Such assurances from this quarter
were but proofs of malevolent intentions. Certain it is that
the tale of official massacres was thenceforth for some
years a continuous one. Abdul Hamid appears to have
deliberately made up his mind, if not to settle the Armenian
question by extermination of the Armenians, once for all,
at least to inflict such a lesson on them as would never be
forgotten. This policy culminated in 1894. Commissioners
were then sent into the country inhabited by Armenians with
directions to summon the Moslems of the district to the
mosques and to inform them of the Sultan’s wishes and
plans. They were to be told that liberty was given to
them to take by force the goods of their Armenian neighbours,
and if there was any resistance to kill them. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
was not an appeal to the fanaticism of the Moslems, but
rather to their greed for loot and to their jealousy of their
more prosperous neighbours.</p>

<p>At the same time every precaution was taken to prevent
the news of these wholesale acts of rapine and massacre
from being known to the outside world. No strangers or
visitors were allowed to enter the country where these scenes
were taking place, and the most rigorous censorship was
applied to all letters coming from them. Save in a few
rare cases where the mollahs refused to obey, in the belief
that the Koran did not justify such acts, the instructions
were acted on and the policy of murder and robbery was
preached in the mosques. In the province of Bitlis twenty-four
Armenian villages were destroyed by Zeki Pasha.
Their inhabitants were butchered. Zeki was decorated by
the Sultan for this infamy. In 1895, and again in 1896,
wholesale massacres of Armenians took place, organized
by Sultan Abdul Hamid, and effected through the agency of
Shakir Pasha and other officials, civil and military. It
was estimated that a hundred thousand Armenians were
victims of these massacres, either directly or indirectly by
starvation and disease which followed them. Constantinople
itself, on August 22 and 28, 1896, was the scene of
an organized attack on the Armenian quarter. It was
invaded by gangs of men armed with clubs, who bludgeoned
every Armenian to be found there. In vain did the ambassadors
protest and appeal to the treaty of Berlin. In
vain did Mr. Gladstone issue, for the last time, from his
retirement and appeal to public opinion on behalf of these
people, designating the Sultan as Abdul the Great Assassin.
No Power was willing to use force or even to threaten
force on behalf of the Armenians. Even Russia was disinclined
to do so. These people had no wish to be
absorbed by Russia. An Armenian of good position and
wide acquaintance with his countrymen in Asia Minor, when
questioned by the writer on this point in 1890, said that
the Armenians had no desire to become subjects of Russia.
They would prefer to remain under the Turks, if England
would hold a big stick over the Sultan; but if England
would not do this, they would prefer Russia, or the devil
himself, to the Turk.</p>

<p>It need not be said that those massacres of 1890-5
have been completely put into the shade by the far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
extensive and bloody massacres of 1915, and that the policy
of deporting the whole population of Armenians has been
carried to a terrible conclusion.</p>

<p>There remains the case of the Macedonians and other
people of the Balkans who were replaced by the treaty of
Berlin under Ottoman rule. The difficulty of dealing with
them was aggravated by the fact that the population of
these districts was not homogeneous. Bulgarians, Greeks,
and Serbians were in many districts mixed up, each with
separate villages or communities, so that no definite
geographical lines could be drawn between them. The
neighbouring States of Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece were
furiously jealous of one another, each claiming these intervening
districts. This, however, was no excuse to the
Porte for the continued misgovernment of these provinces.
Their unfortunate populations, while enduring the evils of
misrule, were able to compare their position under Turkish
rule with that of their more fortunate neighbours who
had been liberated from it by the treaty of Berlin, and
were enjoying all the benefits of self-government in
Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece.</p>

<p>The writer had the opportunity of personally forming an
opinion on this subject. In 1887 and 1890 he paid visits
to Greece, and in 1890 he visited Bulgaria on his way
to Constantinople, staying a few days at Sofia and Philippopolis.
In both cases he was able to compare the new
condition of things with what he recollected of his previous
visits to these districts in 1857. Nothing could be more
striking and more satisfactory to those who had felt confidence
in the principle of self-government and of democratic
institutions. The change in Bulgaria was the more remarkable
as it had been effected in the twelve years which had
elapsed since the treaty of Berlin. In these few years the
Bulgarians had equipped themselves with the machinery
of a progressive democratic community, with schools and
colleges, and with compulsory education. Roads, harbours,
and improvements of all kinds were in course of construction.
The Tartars and Circassians who had been planted in
Bulgaria by the Porte after the conquests by Russia of
the Crimea and the Caucasus, and who were the main
instruments of the horrors of Batak, had again been transplanted
by the Porte in Asia Minor. But the indigenous
Moslems, whether of Slav or Turkish race, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
vehement exhortations of their mollahs, remained and were
well treated by the Christian population now in possession
of power. They had no cause for complaint. They
were represented in the National Assembly of Bulgaria by
not a few men of their own religion.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian peasants, who, under Turkish rule, had in
many parts been driven from the fertile plains into the
Rhodope Mountains and had there formed congested districts,
had migrated again into the plains and were extending cultivation.
A member of the Bulgarian Chamber of Deputies,
when asked by the writer what his constituency of peasants
thought of the change since old Turkish times, replied
that they all admitted that though taxation had not been
reduced there was this great difference: Under the Turkish
régime the taxes went into the pockets of the Turkish
officials and of the Sultan’s gang of robbers at Constantinople,
and the peasants who paid got no return for them.
But under the new régime they had full return for their
money in schools and roads, with other improvements, and
in the protection of life and property. Brigandage, which
used to be rampant, had wholly ceased, and justice could
be obtained from the magistrates without bribes.</p>

<p>In Greece there was everywhere the same story, the
same comparison of the present with the past, to the
immense advantage of the existing state of things.
Brigandage had entirely ceased. Athens had become a
capital worthy of the nation—remarkable for the number
and character of its public buildings and institutions, for its
museums, colleges, and schools, founded for the most part
by wealthy Greeks in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>There remains to consider what had been the relative
and contemporaneous changes in the Balkan provinces still
remaining under Turkish rule and in the (mainly Moslem)
countries of Asia Minor, Syria, and Mesopotamia. To
inquiries of the writer in all quarters, in 1890, there was
but one answer, that since the treaty of Berlin the condition
both of Christians and Moslems throughout the
Turkish Empire had gone from bad to worse. In the
Christian Balkan provinces still under Turkish rule misgovernment
was more rampant. Brigandage had increased.
The rapacity and exactions of the Turkish officials were
worse than ever. Discontent was seething in all directions—the
more so when the populations compared their fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
with that of their more fortunate neighbours across the
frontiers who had been liberated by the armies of Russia
and by the treaty of Berlin. Nor were the reports as to
the condition of the Moslem subjects of the Porte in any
way better. The exactions of Turkish officials had
increased on people of all races and religion. The concurrent
testimony from all quarters was that the condition
of the Moslem peasants had greatly deteriorated.</p>

<p>The writer, on his return from the East in 1890, in
the following paragraph described the danger to Turkey
resulting from this state of things:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The danger to Turkey in its Eastern provinces of Asia Minor and in its
European provinces in Macedonia and Epirus is the comparison between
the condition of those who were freed in 1878 from the Sultan’s rule, and
who have become self-governing, as in the case of the Bulgarians, or have
gone under the rule of Austria, Russia, or Greece, with those who remain
the subjects of Turkish rule. When, on one side of mere geographical
lines, without any physical difference, the populations are flourishing and
improvements of all kinds in roads, railways, harbours, schools, etc., are
being effected; when brigandage is at an end, and the cultivation of land
is extending; when justice is equally administered, and security to life and
property is afforded by the authorities; and when all these improvements
date from the time when they ceased to be under Turkish rule; and when,
on the other side of these lines, the conditions are the same as formerly,
or even worse, and no improvement of any kind has taken place, the
contrast must inevitably lead to fresh aspirations of the peasantry, to
renewed political difficulties, to threats of intervention, and to further
schemes for disintegrating the Empire at no distant date. The real
defects of the Turkish Government appear to be the same as ever, not so
much in the laws themselves as the administration of them, or the want
of administration, the excessive centralization, the want of honest and
capable governors, the corruption which infects all official classes, the
want of money to supply the needs of the central Government and the
extravagance of the Sultan, the consequent excessive taxation, the complete
absence of security for life and property.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span></p>
<p>For seventeen more years these evils continued unabated
in the Ottoman Empire under Abdul Hamid, while the
condition of the liberated provinces was continually improving
and the contrast was becoming every year more
striking. Discontent and disaffection to the Turkish
Government, and contempt and hatred of the Sultan, the
head of it, increased not only among his Christian subjects,
but equally among the Moslems throughout the length and
breadth of the Empire.</p>

<p>The provinces of the Empire which had attained virtual
independence under Moslem rulers, such as Egypt and
Tunis, were little more fortunate in their experience. They
were infected with the same radical defects and misgovernment
as the suzerain Power. In Egypt the enlightened
despotism of Mehemet Ali had degenerated into the corrupt
administration of his grandson, Ismail Pasha. Egypt fell
into the hands of French and English moneylenders, and
millions of borrowed money were squandered by the Pasha
with little or no benefit to his country. Bankruptcy ensued
to the State, and the bondholders persuaded the French and
English Governments to interfere on their behalf and to
insist on a financial control through their Consuls. Later,
in 1881, a popular movement arose in Egypt against this
foreign control, and the army, under Arabi Bey, revolted.
France refused to join with England in putting down the
revolt and in maintaining the dual control. England alone
undertook the task. It sent an army to Egypt, defeated
Arabi and his native army, and restored the nominal rule of
the Khedive. The dual financial control of Great Britain
and France was maintained. But a virtual protectorate by
the former was established, with the result that it became
eventually the master of Egypt.</p>

<p>In no case was the action of Abdul Hamid more fatuous
and more opposed to the real interests of his Empire than
in dealing with this Egyptian question. It was the policy
of Great Britain, at the time we are referring to, pursued
by both political parties in the State, to maintain as far
as possible the authority of the Sultan in Egypt and the
integrity of the Turkish Empire. When, in 1881, Mr.
Gladstone’s Government proposed to send an army for
the temporary occupation of Egypt in order to put down
the rebellion of the Egyptian army, it was most anxious
to do so with the consent and support of the Porte. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
invited Abdul Hamid to send troops there to act in concert
with the British army and in support of his own sovereign
rights. The Sultan refused to do so. He could not be
brought to believe that, in the event of his refusal, the
British Government would act without him. But this was
precisely what it did. A British army was landed in
Egypt and put down the rebellion without any support
from the Sultan. When it was too late, Abdul Hamid
discovered the supreme error of his policy.</p>

<p>Later again, between 1885 and 1887, when Lord Salisbury
was Prime Minister, he was most anxious to come to an
arrangement with the Porte for the ultimate withdrawal of
the British army in occupation of Egypt. He sent a special
envoy (Sir H. Drummond Wolff) to Constantinople, with
the offer of a treaty to the Sultan, under which the British
army was to be wholly withdrawn from Egypt within seven
years, but with the condition that if, later, armed intervention
should again become necessary, British troops should
be employed for the purpose in preference to those of any
other Power. This most friendly and advantageous proposal
was agreed to by all the ministers of the Porte and
was favoured at first by the Sultan, but, after long negotiation,
he refused to sign the treaty. Later, when he perceived
the mistake which he had made, he offered to
reopen the negotiations, but met with a rebuff from Lord
Salisbury. The two incidents are important as showing that
Egypt became a dependency of Great Britain mainly through
the perversity, folly, and stupidity of Abdul Hamid.</p>

<p>In Tunis analogous agencies had been at work in favour
of France. The occupation of this province had been the
subject of conversations between the Powers at the Congress
of Berlin. Prince Bismarck himself suggested it to the
representative of France, hoping perhaps that it would be
the cause of ill-feeling between that country and Italy,
and would widen the breach between them to the advantage
of Germany. The British delegates expressed themselves
as not unfavourable to this project. It followed that,
between 1881 and 1883, the Government of France forcibly
assumed a protectorate over Tunis and a control of its
finance and administration, with the acquiescence, if not
the full approval, of the British Government. In the case of
Tunis, however, its connection with the Turkish Empire
had been virtually severed three centuries earlier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p>Both in Egypt and Tunis, European control effected great
improvements in the condition of the native populations,
especially the peasantry, and afforded illustration to the
people of Turkey of the grave defects of their own Government
and its corrupt administration. A party was gradually
formed in the first decade of the present century among
Moslems in Turkey in favour of constitutional reform. It was
known as the Party of Union and Progress. Its members
were called the Young Turks. It had its origin with Turks
exiled abroad and chiefly living in Paris, and thence it
began to permeate Turkey and find influential support in
Constantinople. It obtained adherents in great numbers in
the Turkish army. It established a Committee at Salonika,
where it was in close touch with the officers of the Turkish
army, which had its headquarters there. By the year 1908
this movement had enormously increased. Among its ablest
members were many Jews and crypto-Jews of Salonika.</p>

<p>There was universal discontent. The system of espionage
which the Sultan had set up, and which was his main
engine of government, was odious to people of every rank,
high and low. The army shared in the discontent. It
was not till they were certain of the support of the army
that the Committee of Union and Progress attempted any
overt act. But when assured of this they boldly proceeded
with their plans. On July 23, 1908, at Salonika, Enver
Bey, on behalf of the Committee, proclaimed a revolution,
and on the same day the 2nd and 3rd Army Corps, stationed
there, declared their intention of marching to Constantinople
and compelling the Sultan to reform the Constitution. It
was decided by the Committee that Abdul Hamid should
not be deposed, but that he should be allowed to remain
on the throne, provided he accepted the Constitution in good
faith. The Committee had further made certain of the
support of the Albanian soldiers who formed the bodyguard
of the Sultan, and who had been looked upon by him
as his most reliable supporters. Abdul Hamid, when he
found that the army was against him and that he had no
friends on whom he could rely, even among his bodyguard,
announced his willingness to concede the demands of the
revolutionary party. Never was a revolution effected with
so little bloodshed and with more complete success. The
Sultan dismissed his corrupt and hated ministers and
appointed others, dictated to him by the Committee. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
agreed to summon again the Parliament which he had
dismissed in 1877. He issued a firman abolishing the
system of espionage. He publicly swore fidelity to the
new Constitution. For a time the people of Constantinople
were willing to believe in his sincerity. The Sheik ul
Islam pronounced that there was nothing in the demands
of the people which was opposed to the laws of Islam.
A general election took place of members for a National
Assembly under a process of double election. Men of all
races and religions were equally admitted to the franchise.</p>

<p>There were everywhere great rejoicings over the new
Constitution, though very few people beyond Constantinople
and Salonika had any conception of what it meant.
There was for a time great enthusiasm for England, and
the new ambassador, Sir Gerard Lowther, on arriving at
Constantinople to take up the post received a great ovation.
On December 10th the new Parliament met, and was opened
by the Sultan with a speech, in which he promised to safeguard
the Constitution and to protect the sacred rights of
the nation. The various Christian and other subject races
were well represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Its
members showed an unexpected ability in the conduct of
its proceedings and in their speeches.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before difficulties began to
arise, and reaction reared its head again at the secret
instigation of the Sultan. There was an outbreak in
Albania against the Committee of Union and Progress.
The bodyguard of Albanians was won back to the support
of Abdul Hamid by profuse bribery. Disorder broke out
in many parts of the Empire. It was at Constantinople,
however, that the gravest dangers to the new order of
things arose. The first act of the new Government was to
dismiss the host of spies, who had been maintained at a
cost of £1,200,000 a year. It was said at the time that
if three persons were seen talking together in the streets
one of them was certain to be a spy in the employment of
the Sultan. These people found their occupation gone.
The new ministers also cleared the public departments of a
vast body of superfluous and useless employés, most of them
hangers-on of the palace. These two classes of people
made a formidable body of malcontents, who conceived
that their fortunes depended on the restoration to the Sultan
of his old powers of corruption. They were supported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
a small body of fanatical mollahs, who believed, or pretended
to believe, that the new Constitution was in opposition
to the sacred law. But more important than these
agencies of reaction were the personal efforts made by
Abdul Hamid to tamper with the fidelity to the new Government
of the troops at Constantinople by the profuse distribution
of money from his private stores. The new
ministers had also made the mistake of releasing from
prison, not merely great numbers of persons imprisoned
at the will of the Sultan for political reasons, but also all
the prisoners convicted of serious crimes. These formed
an element of disorder in the city and caused alarm and
distrust among the well-disposed citizens.</p>

<p>On April 13, 1909, nine months after promulgation of
the new Constitution, a revolt broke out among the troops
at Constantinople, and a counter-revolution was proclaimed.
It had no ostensible leader of any repute or influence.
Abdul Hamid avoided committing himself openly to the
movement. But for the moment, backed by elements of discontent,
it was successful. The new ministers, the members
of the Committee of Union and Progress, and the members
of the new Assembly were compelled to seek safety by
flight. If Abdul Hamid had boldly come forward as the
champion of the reactionaries and fanatics, he might have
crushed his enemies and have restored the old régime.
But he lacked the courage for a desperate game. He
contented himself with the secret supply of money in
support of the movement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Committee of Young Turks met at
Salonika, and determined to put down the counter-revolution
by force. They called on Mahmoud Shefket Pasha, in command
of the 3rd Army Corps, to support them. He said
that he had sworn to maintain the Constitution, and agreed
to march his army to Constantinople. At San Stefano he
met the members of the Assembly and the ministers who
had fled from the city. By the 24th of April the army
had overcome the feeble opposition of the rebellious troops
and were in occupation of the most important parts of
the capital. The counter-revolution was suppressed at a
very small cost of lives. The National Assembly met again,
and the first question for their decision was what should
be done with Abdul Hamid. They put the following question
to the Sheik ul Islam:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<p>“What should be done with a Commander of the
Faithful who has suppressed books and important dispositions
of the Sharia law; who forbids the reading of, and
burns, such books; who wastes public money for improper
purposes; who, without legal authority, kills, imprisons, and
tortures his subjects and commits tyrannical acts; who,
after he has bound himself by oath to amend, violates
such oath and persists in sowing discord so as to disturb
the public peace, thus occasioning bloodshed?</p>

<p>“From various provinces the news comes that the population
has deposed him; and it is known that to maintain
him is manifestly dangerous and his deposition is advantageous.</p>

<p>“Under these conditions, is it permissible for the actual
governing body to decide as seems best upon his abdication
or deposition?”</p>

<p>The answer was the simple word ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Never was a sovereign condemned by a more emphatic
and laconic word. Upon this the National Assembly
unanimously decided on the deposition of Abdul Hamid.
They sent a deputation to the palace to inform him to this
effect. He appears to have taken the sentence of deportation
very quietly. “It is Kismet,” he said. “But will
my life be spared?” He who had been so merciless to
others was chiefly concerned now in claiming mercy for
himself. He pleaded that he had not put to death his
two brothers, Murad and Réchad. The question was
reserved for the National Assembly.</p>

<p>Abdul Hamid found himself deserted and friendless. He
was execrated by his subjects and despised and distrusted
by all his fellow sovereigns in Europe, unless it were the
German Emperor, who, of late years, had given a support
to him in all his misdeeds at home and abroad. In his
hour of peril the Emperor gave him no support, but the
reverse. When he found how the wind was blowing,
William II commenced an intrigue with the Committee
of Union and Progress through Enver Bey, who had
received a military training in Germany and was personally
known to him. It is said that the Emperor insisted as
a condition of recognition of the new order that the life
of Abdul Hamid should be spared. There was another
reason for doing so—namely the hope of the Young Turks
to squeeze his hidden wealth from the deposed Sultan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
However that may be, Abdul Hamid’s life was spared. He
was deported with a few of the more favoured members
of his harem to Salonika, where he was detained as a
virtual prisoner, but not otherwise maltreated. After his
departure money and diamonds to the value of over a
million pounds sterling were found in his palace, a small
part only of his ill-gotten wealth. Two millions sterling
were deposited with German banks and very large sums
were in the hands of the Emperor William. Thus ended
a reign of thirty-three years, more disastrous in its immediate
losses of territory and in the certainty of others to
follow, and more conspicuous for the deterioration of the
condition of his subjects, than that of any other of his
twenty-three degenerate predecessors since the death of
Solyman the Magnificent.</p>

<h2><small>XXII</small><br /><br />

THE YOUNG TURKS<br />

<small>1909-14</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mehmet Réchad</span> was proclaimed Sultan in place of his
brother, under the title of Mahomet V, at the age of
sixty-four. He had spent the whole period of his manhood
as a virtual prisoner, the last thirty-four years of
it under the close surveillance of his brother. He was
never allowed to have friends or even to read newspapers.
His servants were in the pay of Abdul Hamid and acted
as spies on him. He devoted his life to his harem. It
was not surprising that he lost what little intellect he was
originally endowed with. A diplomatist who had many
opportunities of seeing him since his elevation to the throne
thus describes him:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The very appearance of Mahomet V suggests nonentity. Small and
bent, with sunken eyes and deeply lined face, an obesity savouring of
disease, and a yellow, oily complexion, it certainly is not prepossessing.
There is little or no intelligence in his countenance, and he never lost a
haunted, frightened look, as if dreading to find an assassin lurking in some
dark corner ready to strike and kill him.... Abdul Hamid hated and
despised him, but was afraid to have him killed—perhaps through fear
that a stronger man might take his place.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The new Sultan had not been a party to the conspiracy
which dethroned his brother. No one in his senses would
have entrusted him with so important a secret. It was
said of him that he simulated the mannerisms of an idiot
in order to allay suspicion in the mind of Abdul Hamid
that he took any interest in politics. He lived in constant
fear of being put to death. A portrait of this degenerate
would explain better than words, if it were not too cruel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>the depth to which the once proud race of Othman has
fallen. It was probable, however, that the cunning men who
engineered the revolution thought it would better serve
their purpose to have a cipher as the figure-head of the
Empire than a man with a will of his own.</p>

<p>After the defeat of the reactionaries and the deposition
of Abdul Hamid, in 1909, the Young Turks had another
spell of power, during which they had the opportunity of
effecting reforms in the administration of the Empire. They
made a bad use of it. It soon became evident that there
were two sections in the Committee in violent antagonism
to one another. That which succeeded in getting the
upper hand was chauvinistic, vehemently national in its
objects and methods, aiming at the enforcement of unity
throughout the Empire by Turkifying everything, without
regard to local customs or to difference of race. They
endeavoured to impose the Turkish language on the many
subject races who spoke only their own language. They
forbade the teaching in schools of the Albanian language
in Albania, and of Arabic, the sacred language of Islam,
in Arabia. They introduced compulsory service for the
army, and forced the Christians of the Balkan provinces
to serve in its ranks, with the result that thousands of
young Bulgarians, Greeks, and Serbians, inhabitants of
Macedonia, fled the country and sought refuge in the neighbouring
States. The Young Turks availed themselves of
the opportunity which this afforded them of strengthening
the Moslem population of Macedonia by inviting thousands
of the lowest class of Moslem Bosnians to migrate there.
These men were the cause of grave disturbance and disorder.
No provision was made for their employment.
Committees of Young Turks were formed there, who incited
the Turkish local authorities to deeds of arbitrary tyranny
rivalling, if not excelling, the infamies of Abdul Hamid’s
rule. The autocracy of that tyrant was broken at Constantinople
and his system of espionage, which had caused
such indignation, was suppressed, but hundreds of local
Abdul Hamids came into existence in the provinces.</p>

<p>The central Government at the capital followed the method
of the late Sultan in minute interference with every detail
of administration. There can be no doubt that the condition
of the Christian provinces of the Empire became
worse than ever. Meanwhile the enthusiasm for England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
and for the principles of the British Constitution cooled
down at Constantinople. Whatever may have been the
cause, the fact was certain that British influence at the
Porte fell to a vanishing point, while that of Germany
rapidly rose. The military alliance which has been so
valuable to Germany in the existing great war was then
formed. The period was also marked by repeated changes
of the Grand Vizier, according as one or other section
of the Young Turks got the upper hand.</p>

<p>It was not long before the process of dismemberment
of the Empire was renewed and the wolves were gathered
round it to share in the spoil. The Young Turks were
less successful in resisting them than Abdul Hamid, who,
at least, had kept them at bay by his cunning and shifty
diplomacy during the many years which had elapsed since
the Congress of Berlin, though it may well be said of
him that the pent-up evils of his long misgovernment were
in great part responsible for the dismemberments which
followed in the régime of the Young Turks.</p>

<p>Very soon after the revolution of 1908, on October 7th,
before there was experience of the new Constitution, the
Austro-Hungarian Government took advantage of the crisis
and proclaimed the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
in defiance of the treaty obligations imposed by the Great
Powers at Berlin. There was no attempt to justify this. The
annexations made little or no difference to the people of
the two provinces. They were already, for all practical
purposes, under the rule of Austria-Hungary. The main
difference was that the Bosnian soldiers discarded the fez
which they wore as the symbol of Ottoman suzerainty.
The annexation, however, caused great indignation among
the Turks, who regarded it as an insult to their Empire.
It was also the cause of ill-feeling in Russia, and did
something to bring about the great war of 1914. The
Austrian Government gave up its occupation of the Sandjak
of Novi-Bazar and agreed to take over a share of the
Ottoman debt, to the amount of about four millions sterling.
As these concessions were accepted, the Porte must be
held to have condoned the offence. Prince Ferdinand of
Bulgaria very soon followed the example of the Austro-Hungarian
Government. He proclaimed himself an independent
sovereign. This also made very little practical
difference to his subjects. On October 12th the Cretan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Assembly proclaimed the union of the island with
Greece.</p>

<p>The next blow to the Ottoman Empire came from a
very unexpected quarter, from Italy, which made a sudden
and unprovoked attack on Tripoli. This province in Africa
had never been autonomous. It was an integral part of
the Ottoman Empire, governed directly from Constantinople.
Its population was purely Moslem—Turks and Moors
in the city of Tripoli and other places on the coast, and
with semi-independent Arabs in the hinterland. There was
no demand on the part of these natives for a change of
government. Italy had no valid cause of complaint on
behalf of its few subjects who resided in the province,
though it trumped up something of the kind. It was a
case of pure aggression, prompted by jealousy of France
in respect of Tunis, to which, geographically and economically,
Italy had a stronger claim. It may be confidently
assumed that the French Republic gave its consent to the
seizure of Tripoli by Italy, and that Great Britain acquiesced
in it, if it did not formally approve.</p>

<p>Up to the end of 1910, the Italian Government had constantly
professed the desire to maintain the integrity of the
Turkish Empire. When rumours arose of an intention
to grab Tripoli, its Foreign Minister, so late as December
2, 1910, emphatically denied them in the Italian
Chamber. “We desire,” he said, “the integrity of the
Ottoman Empire and we wish Tripoli always to remain
Turkish.” Nothing had since occurred to disturb the relations
between the two countries. But in September 1911
the Italian Government sprang a mine on the Porte by
declaring its intention to occupy Tripoli. On October 26th
it notified to the Powers of Europe its intention to annex
that province. It sent an army of fifty thousand men for
the purpose. Its fleet bombarded the Turkish town of
Prevesa, in the Adriatic, and drove the Turkish fleet to
seek refuge within the Dardanelles. It took possession
of several of the islands in the Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>The Porte was caught at a disadvantage. Abdul Hamid
had for many years completely neglected his navy. He
owed it a grudge for having taken part in the deposition
of his predecessor. He feared that its guns might be
trained on his palace. He had allowed the Minister of
Marine, the most corrupt and greedy of all his Pashas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
to appropriate to his own use the money allotted by the
budget for the repair of warships. For many years the
battleships never left the Golden Horn. But for this the
Ottoman navy, which in the time of Abdul Aziz had
been the third most powerful in Europe, might have made
the landing of an Italian army in Africa impossible. The
garrison in Tripoli, which Abdul Hamid had always maintained
in strength, had been greatly reduced by the Young
Turks. The reinforcement of it after the declaration of
war, when Italy had command of the sea, was a very
difficult task, the more so as the British Government proclaimed
the neutrality of Egypt, though it was still tributary
to the Porte, and forbade the passage of Turkish troops
into Tripoli.</p>

<p>In spite of these obstacles, the Porte made a gallant
fight for its African province, with the aid of the Arabs
of the hinterland. Both Turkish and Italian armies committed
the most horrible atrocities in this war, and there
was little to choose between them in this respect. The war
lasted till October, 1912, and was only brought to an end
when the Porte found itself confronted by danger from a
quarter much nearer home.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the war with Italy, the
consequent engagement of a large Turkish army in defence
of Tripoli, and the blockade of Turkish ports by the Italian
navy, making it difficult for the Porte to transfer its troops
from Asia direct to the Balkan States, precipitated the
intervention of Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia on behalf of
the Christian inhabitants of the remaining provinces of
the Porte in Europe, which were now on the eve of revolt.</p>

<p>The condition of these Christian provinces had in no
way improved under the régime of the Young Turks, but
very much the reverse. The governors and other Ottoman
officials were as corrupt, rapacious, and arbitrary as they
had ever been. There was no security for life or property.
The Turkish soldiers plundered the villages of Christians
which they were sent to protect. Bands of brigands, sometimes
wearing the uniforms of Greek, sometimes of
Bulgarian soldiers, devastated the country. No attempt
was made by the Young Turks to put in force any part
of the reforms which had been proposed by the Commission
appointed by the Great Powers after the Congress of
Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Fitzmaurice’s scheme remained as much a dead letter
as it had been for over thirty years under Abdul Hamid.
The Young Turks had added new difficulties and more
causes of complaint by their attempts to Turkify everything,
and by their extension of conscription to the Christian
population. The physical situation of Macedonia made it
impossible that its people would willingly submit to this
continued misgovernment and tyranny. Their immediate
neighbours were Bulgarians, Serbians, and Greeks, of
kindred race, all of whom, with the assistance of Russia
and other European Powers, had obtained freedom from
Turkish rule. The peoples of Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia
sympathized with their compatriots who were still under
the detested yoke.</p>

<p>If ever intervention by neighbouring States was justified
for the purpose of restoring order and securing good
government in accordance with treaty obligations, this was
a case for it. The crisis was precipitated by massacres
of Bulgarians at Kotchana, in Macedonia, and of Serbians
on the borders of Montenegro.</p>

<p>Early in 1912 negotiations for armed intervention in
Macedonia took place between the Governments of Greece,
Bulgaria, and Serbia, at the instance mainly of the able
and patriotic Premier of Greece, M. Venezelos. For the
first and only time in their history a combination was
effected between these three States against the Turkish
Empire. It will be seen that, though it was most effective
for its immediate purpose of defeating the Turks and expelling
them from nearly the whole of their European
possessions, it broke down, with most unfortunate results,
almost immediately after this great success.</p>

<p>On March 18, 1912, a treaty was signed between
Bulgaria and Serbia for mutual military aid to one another
in war with Turkey. A secret clause provided that in
the event of any portion of Macedonia being conquered the
parts respectively nearest to the two States should be
annexed to them, and that the intervening territory should
be divided between them by the arbitration of Russia.
This clearly showed that the intervention aimed at territorial
conquest. Two months later another treaty was signed
between Greece and Bulgaria, binding the two States to
aid one another if attacked by Turkey, or in the event
of systematic violation of rights by that Power. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
was said in this as to the division of spoil after the war.
Montenegro later came into the chain of alliances, and, in
fact, was always eager for war with Turkey.</p>

<p>When it became known to the Great Powers that these
alliances were formed, and that war was imminent, they
made every effort to allay the storm and to maintain peace.
A strong protest was addressed, on September 25th, by
Russia and Austria on behalf of all the Powers. They
endeavoured to resuscitate the treaty of Berlin, which had
so signally failed, to secure order and good government in
the remaining Christian provinces of Turkey. They undertook,
by virtue of the twenty-third article of that treaty,
to insist on the realization of the promised reforms in the
administration of these provinces, but with the reservation,
which made the promise futile in the eyes of all concerned,
that the reforms should not in any way diminish the
sovereignty of the Sultan or impair the integrity of the
Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>The allied Balkan States, in a very dignified despatch
of October 15th, declined to act on the advice of the
Powers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Governments of the Balkan States [they said] consider that after so
many promises of reform have been so often and so solemnly given by
Turkey, it would be cruel not to endeavour to obtain in favour of the
Christian population of the Ottoman Empire reforms of a more radical
and definite nature which would really ameliorate their miserable condition
if applied sincerely and in their integrity.</p></blockquote>

<p>They enclosed a copy of an ultimatum which, on the
same day, they addressed to the Porte, insisting on the
carrying out of a series of reforms specially detailed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If [they said] the Porte desires to accept these proposals, order and
tranquillity will be reinstated in the provinces of the Empire, and a
desirable peace will be assured between Turkey and the Balkan States,
which have hitherto suffered from the arbitrary and provocative measures
adopted by the Porte to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the list of reforms insisted on was the ceding
and confirmation of the ethnical autonomy of provinces of
the Empire, with all its consequences. The ultimatum was
presented to the Porte, which treated it as a declaration of
war. Its first and most important act was to come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
terms with Italy in order to free its hands for the more
important war at its very portals. A treaty of peace was
signed on October 15th, by which the Porte agreed to
withdraw its troops from Tripoli, and thus virtually recognized
the acquisition of that province by Italy. Italy, on
the other hand, agreed to withdraw from the islands of
the Ægean Sea which it had occupied—a promise which, in
fact, it did not perform.</p>

<p>Meanwhile hostilities had already commenced in the
Balkans. Montenegro declared war on October 8th. The
three other States followed suit on October 18th, and each
of them sent its army on the same day, or nearly so, across
its frontiers to invade Turkey. Beyond the desire for the
better government of the Christian provinces of Turkey,
there were doubtless <i>arrières pensées</i> on the part of all
the allied States. Greece coveted Crete and other islands
in the Ægean Sea, and hoped to extend its frontiers on
the mainland. Bulgaria yearned for the big Bulgaria as
defined by the treaty of San Stefano. Serbia had ambitions
for a revival of its wide boundaries under Stephen Dushan,
and aimed at access both to the Ægean Sea and the Adriatic.
Montenegro wished for a part of Albania and for extensions
in the Adriatic. Each State had large populations
of a kindred race beyond its frontier suffering from cruel
misgovernment and tyranny and crying for help. But it
seems improbable that they could have expected to realize
their full hopes, or to achieve such a <i>dénouement</i> as actually
occurred.</p>

<p>The allies between them had seven hundred thousand men
under arms. Turkey had no more than four hundred
thousand in Europe. It had, however, great reserves in
Asia, and its aggregate force largely exceeded that of
the allies. It was to be expected that the Turkish armies
in Europe would make a good fight, and would at least
afford time for these reserves to come up.</p>

<p>The Greek army, under the command of the Crown
Prince Constantine (the present King of Greece), who had
received a military education in Germany, crossed the
northern frontier and, in four days, on October 22nd,
encountered a Turkish army, under Hassan Pasha, at
Sarandoporus. The Turks held a very strong position and
were little inferior in numbers. In spite of this, they
were worsted, and were compelled to retreat in the follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>ing
night. The next day the Greeks renewed their attack.
The unfortunate Turks, disheartened by their defeat at
Sarandoporus and wearied by the long night march, were
caught unawares in a ravine which offered no possibility of
defence. Terror-stricken and demoralized, they fled before
their foe. They left behind them the whole of their artillery
and transport.</p>

<p>The retreating Turks, despite their panic, found time to
wreak their vengeance on the unfortunate Christian inhabitants
on their route and mercilessly butchered them.
What remained of their army retired on Veria, where it was
reinforced by fourteen fresh battalions. On the 28th the
Greek army resumed its march. In front of Veria it again
came in contact with the Turks, who were posted in a
very strong position. The issue was not long in doubt.
The unhappy Turks were mown down by the Greek guns.
Officers and men again fled like a beaten rabble. After
these signal defeats the remainder of the Ottoman army
crossed the River Vardar on November 3rd, within a few
miles of Salonika. On the 8th that city capitulated to the
Greeks, not without suspicion of treachery. Hassan Pasha
and twenty-five thousand men, the remains of his army,
were made prisoners. On the next day a division of the
Bulgarians, detached from their main army in Thrace,
appeared on the scene at Salonika, after a forced march,
in the hope of being able to claim a share in the capture
of that important city. At the request of its general,
the Greeks gave permission to two regiments of Bulgarians
to enter the city. In spite of this limitation, ten regiments
were sent there, and were the cause of much subsequent
trouble.</p>

<p>While these great and unexpected successes were being
achieved by the Greeks, the Serbians were advancing from
the north. A Turkish army of a hundred thousand men,
under Zeki Pasha, had marched up the valley of the
Vardar River to meet them. The two armies, about equal
in numbers, met at Koumanovo on October 23rd, the day
after the victory of the Greeks at Sarandoporus. The
Turks were well supported with all modern implements of
war, with machine guns, aeroplanes, and wireless telephone
apparatus, but they had not a staff competent to make use of
them. Their artillery was the best which Krupps’ celebrated
German works could turn out, and was superior in number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
to that of the Serbians. The French Creüsot guns, however,
of the latter proved to be the better in action. But, worst of
all, the commissariat arrangements of the Turks were of
a most primitive character. They relied mainly on their
men feeding themselves at the expense of the peasantry
on their route, with the result that they were underfed.
The weather was most inclement and the troops were only
provided with light summer clothing. The best of soldiers
cannot fight with empty stomachs and scanty clothing. As
a result, in spite of a vigorous resistance in the great
battle, the Turkish lines were broken by the splendid
infantry of the Serbians. There resulted a rout and the
precipitate retreat of the Turkish army. It lost the whole
of its artillery—a hundred and twenty guns. Of the
hundred thousand men, only forty thousand survived as
a military force. Uskub, the ancient capital of Serbia,
was captured. Another Serbian army advanced towards
the Adriatic and captured Durazzo.</p>

<p>After the fierce and decisive battle at Koumanovo, what
remained of the Turkish army retreated down the Vardar
Valley to Veles, and thence, instead of marching to Salonika,
where it might have been in time to save that city from the
Greeks, it marched westward to Prilip, on the route to
Monastir. The Serbians, after a brief delay, followed it
up and came in contact again at Prilip, where the Turks
held an immensely strong position. It was taken at the
point of the bayonet, a striking proof of the superb quality
of the Serbian infantry.</p>

<p>The Turks retreated thence to Monastir, where they found
reinforcements. On November 17th and 18th, another great
battle was fought in front of Monastir, in which the Turks
were again defeated, with the loss of ten thousand prisoners.
The remains of the army retreated into Albania, where it
was too late in the season for the Serbians to follow them.
They were ultimately, in the following spring, brought back
to Constantinople by sea from the Adriatic. There could
not have been a more completely victorious campaign for
the Serbians. Zeki’s army was virtually extinguished.</p>

<p>While these critical events were pending in Macedonia
the Bulgarians were equally successful in the east. They
invaded Thrace on October 18th in great force, and on
the 22nd encountered a Turkish army at Kirk Kilisse and,
after a two days’ battle, defeated it. On the 28th they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
fought the main Turkish army, under Nazim Pasha, which
was drawn up in a line from Lulu Burgas to Viza. The
Turks made an obstinate resistance, but after forty-eight
hours of fierce assaults by the Bulgarians they gave way
and retreated in terrible disorder, till they found themselves
behind the lines of Tchatalja, the celebrated fortifications
which protect Constantinople at a distance of nineteen miles
on a line from the Black Sea to the Marmora. On their
advance through Thrace the Bulgarian soldiers, assisted by
irregulars of Bulgar race, committed atrocities and cruelties
on the Turkish population which rivalled all that the Turks
in the past had perpetrated.</p>

<p>On November 17th the Bulgarians attacked these lines
of Tchatalja with great vigour. But the Turks had brought
up fresh troops from Asia. The lines were well defended
with Krupp guns, and several successive assaults were
repelled.</p>

<p>On December 3rd, at the instance of the Great Powers,
an armistice was agreed upon between Turkey and Bulgaria
and Serbia. War, however, was continued with Greece
and Montenegro. As a result of the campaign the Turks
had been defeated in every engagement by Greeks, Serbs,
Bulgars, and Montenegrins. They were driven from
Macedonia and from nearly the whole of Thrace and Epirus.
They still, however, retained Adrianople, Janina, and
Scutari. It was only when in defence of such cities, or
behind such lines as those of Tchatalja that the Turkish
soldiers showed the tenacity and courage for which they
had been famous. Whenever they met the enemy in the
open field they were always defeated.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is almost incomprehensible [wrote Mr. Crawford Price, who was
a witness of this <i>débâcle</i> of the Turkish army] that this warlike nation,
the stories of whose valour fill the most thrilling pages of the military
history of the world, could have degenerated into a beaten rabble flying
before the onslaught of despised Serbians and Greeks, people who, till
yesterday, scarce dared to lift their voices when questions affecting their
interests were discussed and settled. The Greeks most effectually wiped
out the stain of 1897. They showed themselves the superior of the Turk
in organization, strategy, and even in personal courage.... I do not
wish to dwell too strongly on the lack of courage exhibited by the
Ottoman soldiers. Words fail me to describe the utter demoralization
I found in the ranks of the Turkish troops after their defeat.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>
<p>Among the chief causes of this demoralization of the
Ottoman armies was the complete absence of preparation
for feeding them. It was the rule, rather than the exception,
for the troops to be left three or four days without
food. Another cause was that the Ottoman armies in this
campaign in Europe had in their ranks a large proportion
of Christian natives of the district who had been conscripted
for the first time. Their sympathies were all in favour
of the enemy, and they undoubtedly assisted in promoting
the stampedes when the Turkish lines were broken. The
survivors fled to their homes.</p>

<p>The winter of 1912-13, after the conclusion of the
armistice, was spent in futile negotiations for peace at a
Conference in London. The main cause of failure was
Adrianople. The Bulgarians insisted on its cession to them
as a condition of permanent peace. The Porte, in the
first instance, was not unwilling to give way on this. But
a military <i>émeute</i> occurred at Constantinople. A deputation
from the army, headed by Enver Bey, insisted on
entering the chamber where the Council of Ministers were
deliberating on the question, with the object of protesting
against the surrender of the stronghold. Nazim Pasha, the
Minister of War, and his aide-de-camp were killed in the
endeavour to resist this inroad. The Grand Vizier was
thereupon terrorized into resignation. In his place Mahmoud
Shefket, who had proved to be so loyal to the Young
Turks at the early stage of their movement, was appointed.
He refused to surrender Adrianople. The negotiations in
London were broken off.</p>

<p>Early in 1913, on January 4th, the Bulgarians gave
notice of the termination of the armistice. War was
renewed. On February 4th the Bulgarian army commenced
an attack on Adrianople, supported on this occasion by
fifty thousand Serbians. On the same day they fought a
battle near Bulair, defeated the Turks, and captured that
important fortress, threatening the command of the Dardanelles.
The Greeks also renewed the war. They sent an
army into Epirus and, on March 6th, captured Janina,
making prisoners thirty-three thousand Turks and seizing
immense stores of guns and ammunition. On the 10th of
the same month their fleet captured the island of Samos.</p>

<p>On March 28th the Bulgarians captured Adrianople and
its garrison of twenty thousand Ottomans, and on April 21st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
the Montenegrins succeeded in getting possession of Scutari,
which they claimed as the capital of their State. After
these serious reverses the Porte was desirous of coming
to terms, and was willing even to cede Adrianople and
almost the whole of Thrace. It invited the mediation of
the Great Powers. The allied States agreed to this. A
second Conference was held in London on the basis that
the Porte was to give up all its possessions in Europe, save
the small part of Thrace south of a line drawn from Enos,
in the Ægean Sea, to Media, in the Black Sea, a few miles
north of the Tchatalja lines. Crete was to be ceded to
Greece, and the destination of the islands in the Ægean Sea
lately in the possession of Turkey, and some of which were
necessary for its defence, was to be left to the decision of the
Powers. A treaty was effected between the Porte and the
Powers to this effect. But there was far greater difficulty
in determining how the ceded districts were to be divided
between the victorious Balkan States. The position was
aggravated by Roumania coming into the field and claiming
compensation in territory, in consideration of the
important changes impending in the balance of power in
the Balkans.</p>

<p>The four States so lately in alliance against the
common enemy, Turkey, were now madly jealous of one
another in the division of the spoils. Serbia, which had
contributed so largely to the result by the splendid valour
of its army against the main body of Turks under Zeki
Pasha, was not content with the small slice of Macedonia
which it had agreed to in the treaty with Bulgaria in
1912, before the war. The decision of the Powers that
Albania was to be an independent State deprived Serbia of
the much-hoped-for access to the Adriatic. The acquisition
by Bulgaria of Thrace, including Adrianople, would greatly
alter the balance of power in the Balkans to the disadvantage
of Serbia and justified its claim to a larger share of
Macedonia. It was already in occupation of nearly half
of that province. Bulgaria was equally ambitious to revive
the big Bulgaria of the San Stefano treaty, and could also
appeal to long past history in favour of it. It was determined
to get possession of Salonika, and was madly jealous
of Greece. The Greeks, on their part, were in possession
of that city and of the southern half of Macedonia. They
had got hold of these districts by force of arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
were determined not to give them up. No agreement could
be come to in London. Russia in vain did its utmost to
compose these differences. It offered to act as arbitrator
and invited the Balkan States to send representatives to
Petrograd to settle the questions.</p>

<p>We now know that the Bulgarian Government had no
intention whatever to make concessions to the other Balkan
States. The pacific section of its ministers were overborne
by the more bellicose members. M. Gueshoff, the
able Premier, who had been responsible for the policy
which preceded the war, and who was now in favour of a
peaceful settlement, was compelled to resign. King
Ferdinand, a most unscrupulous and ambitious intriguer,
backed up the war party, and was mainly responsible for
the treacherous policy pursued, which was fraught with so
much misfortune to his State. In spite of the warnings
from Russia that, if force were resorted to, Bulgaria would
find itself confronted by a Roumanian army, and that the
Porte would also join in the war against it, King
Ferdinand and his Government decided on war with their
late allies. They had unbounded and arrogant confidence
in their army, and despised those of Greece and Serbia.</p>

<p>On June 29, 1913, at midnight, the Bulgarian army in
Macedonia made a sudden and unprovoked attack on the
Greek and Serbian outposts, without any warning or declaration
of war. This treacherous action was followed up
the next day by an advance of the Bulgarian army of
a hundred thousand men on the right flank against the
Serbian army, which was nearest to them. For the moment
this seemed to promise success, and the Serbians were
compelled to fall back. But on July 1st the Serbians,
whose forces, supported by the Montenegrins, were almost
equal in number to the Bulgarians opposed to them, rallied
and decided on a counter offensive. On July 2nd they
attacked the Bulgarians on the Bragalbabza River, defeated
them, and captured many of their guns. On July 4th
another battle took place with much the same result. Istib
was captured on the 8th, and the Bulgarians were then compelled
to retreat towards their own frontier.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main army of the Greeks, which was
concentrated at Salonika, a day’s march from the Bulgarians
on the left flank, advanced to attack them. The two
armies were equal in numbers, each of about seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
thousand men. They met at Kiltich, about half-way
between the Rivers Vardar and Struma, and a day’s march
from Salonika. The Greeks inflicted a very severe defeat
on their foes. This was followed up a few days later by
victories at Doiran and Strumnitza. In the fortnight which
followed the Bulgarians were defeated in a series of engagements
as they retreated to their own frontier.</p>

<p>The prediction and warnings of the Russian Government
were now verified. The Roumanians, when they found that
the Bulgarians were involved in war with the other Balkan
States, announced that they were dissatisfied with the small
concession of territory made to them at the Conference in
London—namely the fortress of Silistria and a belt of land
on the Danube. They insisted on a further cession of
territory to them in the Dobrudscha. They sent an army
across the Danube, on July 10th, to support this demand.
It advanced without opposition to within a few miles of
Sofia. The Turks also saw the opportunity of retrieving
out of the scramble something of their recent great losses
of territory. They determined to tear up the treaty of
London, signed only a few weeks ago. They sent an army,
under Enver Pasha, into Thrace, on July 15th, to attack
Adrianople. It had no difficulty in recapturing that most
important city, from which the Bulgarians had withdrawn
nearly the whole of its garrison in order to strengthen their
armies against Greece and Serbia. It also reoccupied
Demotika and Kirk Kilisse.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians found themselves in a most perilous
position. Their armies had everywhere been defeated and
driven back. They were surrounded by invading armies.
They were compelled to sue for terms. On July 31st an
armistice was agreed to, and a Conference was decided
on, to be held at Bucharest, between the representatives
of the Balkan States, without the presence of those of the
Great Powers. At the Conference the Bulgarians found
themselves in the position of being hoist with their own
petard. They were compelled by <i>force majeure</i> not only
to give up all their ambitious projects, but also to make
serious concessions to all their rivals. Had they been willing
to come to terms at the Conference at London or, later,
to submit to the arbitration of Russia, they would undoubtedly
have secured for themselves a large slice of
Macedonia. They would have retained possession of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
great part of Thrace, with Adrianople and Demotika, and
the only concessions they would have made were Silistria
and the small belt of land on the Danube. They were
now compelled to agree to the division of the whole of
Macedonia between Greece and Serbia. They had to surrender
a part of the Dobrudscha to Roumania, and the
larger part of their conquests in Thrace, including
Adrianople, to the Turks. All that remained to them in
return for their stupendous efforts in the recent wars was
a small portion of Thrace with a narrow frontage to the
Ægean Sea, but without a port of any value or importance.
Never was there a case in which base treachery and overweening
arrogance were followed by more fatal retribution.</p>

<p>Greece got the larger share of the spoil of Turkey in
the two years of war. It obtained rather more than half
of Macedonia—namely 17,000 square miles, with a population
of 1,697,000. It also secured the final cession
to it of the important island of Crete, and of Samos, and
other islands in the Ægean Sea. Its territory and population
were increased by more than one-half. Serbia obtained
15,000 square miles, with 1,656,000 inhabitants, Bulgaria
only 9,600 miles and 125,000 inhabitants. Roumania
secured 2,600 square miles, with 286,000 inhabitants, and
Montenegro 2,100 square miles and 251,000 population;
while the Turks lost 54,000 square miles, inhabited by a
population of 4,239,000. But the recovery of Adrianople,
Demotika, and Kirk Kilisse was a great coup for them.
It redounded to the prestige of the Young Turks and their
leader, Enver Pasha, who soon became Minister of War.</p>

<p>The German Emperor telegraphed his congratulations
to the Sultan on the recovery of Adrianople, and to the
King of Roumania on the success of his intervention. He
also conferred on the King of Greece, his brother-in-law,
the bâton of a Field Marshal in the German army. The
King received this honour in person at Berlin in the presence
of a great gathering of German generals. In a speech
on the occasion, he attributed his success in the recent
war, in the first place, to the bravery of his army, and in
the second to the training which he and many of his
officers had received in the military schools of Berlin.
Thenceforth, till the outbreak of the great war in Europe
in 1914, the influence of Germany in the Near East, and
especially in Turkey, was continually on the increase. Enver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Pasha, who now predominated in the councils of the Porte,
was devoted to the interests of Germany, and was probably
in its pay. At his instance the Turkish army, which
had so conspicuously failed in the recent wars, was put
under the control of the German General Von der Goltz,
and large numbers of officers were lent by Germany for
its better training. Secret drillings of troops took place
in many remote parts of the Empire. These measures
were well timed to coincide with the outbreak in 1914 of the
great war, which, it is now very certain, had been already
determined on by the General War Staff at Berlin.</p>

<p>It only remains to add that when, soon after the commencement
of the war, the Porte, at the instance of Enver
Pasha, declared itself against the Allied Powers, the British
Government at once proclaimed the independence of Egypt,
under its protectorate, and the annexation of Cyprus. These
were the last territorial losses of the Ottoman Empire which
can be counted as <i>faits accomplis</i>. It has been shown
that, in the past, there were due to the régime of the
Young Turks, during the six years of its predominance,
from 1908 to 1914, the loss in Europe of Macedonia,
Epirus, and Albania, and of a large part of Thrace; of
Crete, Cyprus, and many other islands in the Ægean Sea;
and the suzerainty of Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Herzegovina;
and in Africa of the province of Tripoli and the suzerainty
of Egypt. These great losses rivalled in extent of territory
and population those incurred either by Mahmoud II
or by Abdul Hamid II. It needs no prophet to predict a
further shrinkage of territory, or loss of independence, after
the conclusion of the existing war in Europe, whatever may
be its other results.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><small>XXIII</small><br /><br />

A RETROSPECT</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been shown in preceding chapters that the two
great historic movements of the growth and decay of the
Turkish Empire extended over periods not differing much
in length. Reckoning its birth from the accession, in
1288, of Othman, as chief of a small tribe of Turks in
Asia Minor, nearly three hundred years elapsed before the
Empire reached its zenith. During these years ten eminent
Sultans and one Grand Vizier (Sokolli) of a degenerate
Sultan were concerned in its extension. It was a period
of almost continuous victory and conquest. The Ottoman
armies, during these years, met with only a single serious
disaster, that at Angora in 1402 at the hands of Timur
and a host of Mongolian invaders, which seemed at first
to have struck a fatal blow to the Empire. But it soon
rallied, and the process of aggrandizement was renewed.
With this exception the Ottomans were almost uniformly
successful. The number, however, of pitched battles in
the field, which decided the fate of States successively
invaded, was not great. Thrace was won by the defeat
of the Byzantines by Murad I at Eski Baba in 1361.
The Bulgarians were conquered at Samakof in 1371, and
the Serbians at Kossova in 1389, by the same Sultan. The
Hungarians were overthrown at Mohacz in 1529. The
Persians were defeated at Calderan, 1514, near Tabriz,
and the Egyptians at Aleppo, 1516, and Ridania, near
Cairo, under Selim, 1516. The crusaders from Europe
were defeated in three great battles—at the Maritza, 1363,
Nicopolis, 1396, and Varna, 1444. At most of these
battles the Ottomans had great superiority of numbers, and
as against the Persians and Egyptians they were provided
with a powerful artillery, of which their opponents were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
wholly deficient. The other very numerous campaigns consisted
mainly of successions of sieges by invading armies
of Ottomans, where the invaded, with inferior forces,
protracted the defence, often over long terms of years.</p>

<p>The Ottomans were almost equally successful at sea,
with one notable exception, at Lepanto, at the very end of
the period we are referring to, when they met with a
terrible disaster from the combined navies of Europe,
much inferior in numbers of ships and men. But before
this their naval supremacy had enabled them to extend
the Empire over Algiers and Tunis. Nothing resulted
from the great battle of Lepanto except loss of prestige
to the Ottomans. The combination against them was dissolved,
and for many years they maintained supremacy
in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>At the close of this period of growth the Ottoman
Empire reached its zenith and extended over the vast
countries described in the chapter on the Grand Vizier
Sokolli. The whole of its immense area, however, was not
in full ownership of the Ottomans. Parts of it, such as
North Hungary, were autonomous States with native rulers
paying tribute to the Porte. Other parts, such as the Crimea,
Wallachia, and Moldavia, were vassal States, whose princes
were appointed by the Sultan, and which were bound to
send contingents in support of the Ottoman armies when
at war. The really integral parts of the Empire in Europe
were Thrace, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Bosnia,
and Albania; in Asia, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and
a great part of Arabia; and in Africa, Tripoli. Egypt,
Tunis, and Algiers very early acquired a practical autonomy
under the suzerainty of the Porte, though they were still
nominally integral parts of the Empire. The Empire thus
constituted was one of the greatest in the then world.
It may be worth while briefly to review the causes which
led to its aggregation.</p>

<p>It was the common belief in Europe, confirmed by many
historians, up to recent times, that the Ottoman armies
which invaded Europe from Asia Minor were composed of
pure Turks, and that the motive which impelled them in
their conquest was the fanatical desire to extend Islam.
But these views have been modified of late years. It has
been shown that the armies which Sultans Orchan and
Murad led across the Straits into Europe were not pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Turks, but were very largely composed of subjects of the
East Roman Empire from the northern parts of Asia Minor,
who, after the defeat there of the Byzantine armies, had
embraced Islam. They were welded with the Turks by
religion into something approaching to a nation. They called
themselves Osmanlis, or Ottomans, from the founder of the
Othman dynasty. It may be doubted whether the Turks
alone were capable of effecting the conquests in Europe.
It is certain that they could not have maintained the Empire
when formed.</p>

<p>The Turks of Anatolia had many valuable qualities as
soldiers. They were, and are to this day, brave, hardy,
sober, frugal, and cleanly in their habits, as inculcated by
their religion, a strong point in their favour in days when
sanitary arrangements were completely ignored by armies.
They bore the hardships of long campaigns without
complaint. But they were deficient in intelligence and
education, which count for much in war as in civil life.
In this respect they were very inferior to subjects of the
East Roman Empire and to many of the Christians with
whom they came in conflict. But the Ottomans who first
invaded Europe were not simply Turks. Later, the most
effective corps in the Ottoman army was formed exclusively
of the sons of Christian parents in the Balkans,
conscripted at an early age and forcibly converted to Islam.
It was with forces thus constituted that the Ottomans extended
their Empire up to and beyond the Danube. The
conquests of the larger part of Asia Minor, of Mesopotamia,
Syria, and Egypt, were also effected, by composite
forces, to which Serbia and Wallachia sent contingents
by virtue of treaties with the Porte. The greater number
of Ottoman generals who distinguished themselves in these
early days of conquest were not of Turkish race, but were
Greeks, Albanians, Slavs, and Italians, who had embraced
Islam or whose forbears had done so. It was the same with
almost all the naval commanders. They were of foreign
origin, who had gained experience as pirates and had
embraced Islam. The crews who manned the Ottoman
navy were mainly Greeks from the islands in the
Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>With respect to the objects and motives of the Ottoman
conquests, a careful review of the history of the early
Sultans has shown that there was very little, if any, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
missionary enterprise on behalf of Islam. It will be
admitted that there is no pretence for concluding that the
vast conquests in Asia and Africa had any such motive.
The populations there were already Moslems. The motives
for conquest were the ambition to extend the Empire at
the expense of neighbouring States and the hope of plunder
on the part of the soldiers. Religious zeal had nothing to
do with it. What reason is there to suppose that conquests
in Europe had any different object than those in Asia?
As a matter of fact, there was no very large extension of
Islam in Europe as a result of Ottoman conquest. When
cities were captured and their inhabitants were massacred,
or when districts were conquered and the people were
carried away as captives to be sold as slaves, they do not
appear to have had the alternative offered to them of
embracing Islam.</p>

<p>In some few districts, as in Bosnia and parts of Albania
and the Morea, the landowners, or some of them, were
allowed to avoid the confiscation of their property by
becoming Mussulmans. But these were exceptions. The
general rule was that the land of the conquered districts
was confiscated without the option to the owners of changing
their religion and saving their property. As regards the
labouring people, the rayas, there does not appear to
have been any desire that they should adopt the religion
of their conquerors. They were wanted for the cultivation
of the land as serfs or slaves. It seems to have been
a matter of indifference what their religion was.</p>

<p>There is also nothing to show that the Ottoman soldiers
were animated by any religious zeal in their campaigns in
Europe. The main cause of their military efficiency was the
organization of the army effected by Orchan and perfected
by Murad I. It offered immense rewards to the soldiers
for victories in battle and for personal valour, in the share
of booty and plunder levied in the conquered districts,
of captives to be sold as slaves, of women for wives or
concubines or to be sold for harems, and of lands to be
distributed as fiefs. These rewards appealed to the predatory
instincts of the Moslem soldiers, whether Turks
or others of alien origin. In the rare intervals of
peace the soldiers soon wearied of life in barracks, and
yearned for active campaigns. At such times the Janissaries
and other soldiers were a danger to the State from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
turbulence and disorder. It was necessary to find employment
for them at a distance. This acted as a constant
incitement to war and to fresh conquests. It was one of
the causes of the continuous growth of the Empire.</p>

<p>A second main cause of success to the Ottoman armies
in Europe was the want of union for resistance on the part
of the people of the Balkan States. There can be little
doubt that if the Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbians had
combined to resist the invading Moslems their efforts
would have been successful. But Greeks and Bulgarians,
Greeks and Serbians hated one another more than they
feared and hated the Ottomans. In the six centuries dealt
with in this volume there was only a single occasion when
Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbians formed a combination
against the Ottomans. This was not till 1912. The combination
was successful and drove the Turks out of
Macedonia, Epirus, Albania, and the greater part of Thrace.
But we have shown that it broke down on the division
of the spoil, with the result that the Turks recovered a small
part of their lost territory. The case illustrates our contention
that want of union of the Christian States was
a main cause of the servitude of all of them for nearly
five hundred years under Turkish rule.</p>

<p>Lastly, in appreciating the causes of the wonderful
growth of the Ottoman Empire, we must not lose sight
of the personal element, of the fact that, for ten generations,
the Othman family produced men capable of leading
their armies in the field to victory, and almost equally
remarkable as administrators and statesmen. This succession
of a single family, father and son, for ten generations
without a break, culminating in the greatest of them,
Solyman the Magnificent, is quite without precedent or
example in history. The Othman family were pure Turks
in their origin. But the Turkish blood was very soon
diluted. The mothers of future Sultans were either captives
taken by corsairs or slaves bought on account of their
beauty. They were of every race—Greeks, Slavs, Italians,
or Russians. But in spite of this mixed blood the type of
Sultans remained much the same for ten generations. The
prestige acquired by the family in these three hundred
years, as founders and maintainers of the Empire and as
generals who led their armies to victory, was such that it
has impressed itself on the imagination of all Ottomans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
and has survived to this day, in spite of the long subsequent
degeneration of the family. Unquestionably, the
foundation and growth of the Empire were largely due to
the personal qualities of the Othman dynasty.</p>

<p>After the death in 1578 of Grand Vizier Sokolli, who
carried on the traditions of the first ten Sultans for a
few years under the worthless Selim II, the pendulum of
Empire swung in the opposite direction. Thenceforth, down
to the present time, there were successions of defeats and
disasters to the Turkish Empire, with but few intermissions.
Provinces were torn from it periodically, like leaves
from an artichoke, till all but a small fraction of it in
Europe, the whole of its possessions in Africa, and a large
part in Asia have been lost to the Empire. What remains
to it is the core of Turkish and Arabic provinces in Asia,
and in Europe only its capital, Constantinople, and a small
portion of Thrace to the north of it.</p>

<p>Five of the Great Powers of Europe have had their
share of the spoils, and six independent States have been
resuscitated out of the remaining débris of it. It is hard
to say which of the Great Powers gained most. Austria
recovered by force of arms Hungary, Transylvania,
Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slavonia, and by artful policy
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russia obtained by conquest
the Crimea, Bessarabia, Podolia, and a part of the Ukraine
in Europe, and the Caucasus, and a great part of Armenia,
in Asia. France has possessed itself of Algiers and Tunis.
England has secured the suzerainty and practical possession
of Egypt and complete possession of Cyprus and Aden.
Italy has seized Tripoli. Of the six smaller independent
States, Bulgaria and Roumania owe their revival solely to
Russia, Greece mainly to Great Britain and France,
Albania to the concert of the Balkan States in 1912, and
Serbia and Montenegro alone owe their freedom mainly
to their own valour. It need not be said that gratitude
forms no part of the ethics of modern statecraft, and a few
only of the above States have recognized that they owe anything
to the Powers who rescued them from Turkish rule.</p>

<p>During the last three hundred years, when these vast
changes were being effected, the Ottoman army lost all the
prestige it had acquired during the previous three hundred
years. With the single exception of the battle of Cerestes,
fought against the Hungarians in 1646, when a <i>débâcle</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
of the Turkish army was averted by the splendid cavalry
charge of Cicala Pasha, which saved to the Ottoman
Empire the larger part of Hungary for another term of
seventy-two years, its armies were defeated in almost every
battle of any importance. In nearly all of them the Ottomans
had the advantage of very superior numbers, but this
did not save them from disaster. The armies opposed to
them were led by a succession of generals who were masters
of the art of war, such as Sobieski, King of Poland, Prince
Eugène of Savoy, Prince Charles of Lorraine, Generals
Munnich, Loudon, Kutusoff, Suvorov, Diebitsch, Paskievitch,
Skobeleff, and Gourko. Compared with these, the
Turks had not a single general of eminence and only a
few valiant leaders in battle.</p>

<p>To what causes, then, are we to attribute the decay and
dismemberment of the vast Empire, and the complete
failure of its armies to maintain prestige for victory and
valour? It is more easy perhaps to suggest causes for
downfall than for the birth and growth of the Empire.
First and foremost of the causes has unquestionably been
the degeneracy of the Othman dynasty. It could not have
been by a mere chance coincidence that the growth of
Empire was synchronous with the reign of the first ten
Sultans, and that its decay and dismemberment were extended
through the reign of twenty-five successors, of whom
all but two, or possibly three, were degenerates and wholly
incompetent to rule. The Ottoman State was an autocracy
in which all military, civil, and religious faculties were
centred in its head. It needed autocrats competent for
the task, and in the absence of such it was certain that
the State would take the road to ruin. Whether the
degeneracy of the dynasty was due, as has been hinted,
to a break in the true succession, and the introduction of
alien blood after Solyman the Magnificent, or not, the
fact remains that we can discern no trace of the eminent
qualities of the family in those who succeeded him.</p>

<p>The deterioration of the race, which began with Selim
‘the Sot,’ was confirmed and accentuated by what occurred
after three more Sultans had succeeded father to son—all
of them equally unfit to fill the throne. The original
law of succession, which had been set aside by the cruel
practice of fratricide, was then reverted to, and the
eldest male of the family, and not the eldest son of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
defunct Sultan, was recognized as his successor. Thenceforth,
by way of precaution against conspiracy and rebellion,
the reigning Sultans, in lieu of putting their brothers to
death, immured them as virtual prisoners in the building
of the Seraglio known as the Cage, where they were allowed
little or no communication with the world. They were permitted
to maintain their harems, but by some abominable
process the women were sterilized so as to prevent their
giving birth to possible claimants to the throne. Of twenty
successors to Mahomet IV, seventeen were subjected to this
degrading treatment, and only left prison on succeeding to
the throne. Three Sultans escaped this treatment, two of
them by succeeding their fathers, in default of other male
heirs of an older age. Only one of these three was better
equipped to fill the throne than the average of the other
seventeen. It is evident, therefore, that the dynasty was
worn out. It would have been well for the Empire if the
Othman race had long ago come to an end, and had been
replaced by some more virile and competent stock.</p>

<p>It followed, from the degeneracy of this long succession
of Sultans, that the supreme power of the State fell into
other hands, either of viziers who were able to dominate
the reigning Sultans and to secure themselves against
intrigues of all kinds, or more often of the harem. It
would be difficult to exaggerate the evils which resulted
from the intervention of the Sultan’s harem in affairs of
State. The harem consisted of a vast concourse of women
and slaves, of concubines and eunuchs, maintained at a
huge expense—a nest of extravagance and corruption. It
was always in antagonism to the official administration of
the Porte, which ostensibly carried on the administration
of the State under the direction of the Sultan. The
favourite concubine for the time being, or the ambitious
mother of a Sultan, or not infrequently the principal eunuch,
gained the ear of the Sultan and overruled the more experienced
advisers of the Porte. The harem was the centre
from which corruption spread throughout the Turkish
Empire, as officials of every degree, from the highest to the
lowest, found it expedient to secure their interest with
its inmates by heavy bribes. It has been shown in previous
pages that the sale of offices, civil and military, became
universal. This was largely responsible for the decay and
dismemberment of the State. An illustration of this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
to be found in the cases of Egypt, Algiers, and Tunis.
The incompetent pashas, who had obtained by purchase the
governorships of these important provinces, were unable
to control the local Mamelukes in Egypt, or the local
Janissaries in Algiers and Tunis, with the result that these
provinces became practically independent and later were
lost to the Empire.</p>

<p>A second main cause of the decadence of the Empire
was undoubtedly the deterioration of its armies. We miss
altogether in the many great battles of the last three
hundred years the élan and the daring spirit by which the
Ottomans won their many victories in the period of accretion
of the Empire. Two main explanations may be offered
for this. The one that the armies in the later period
were formed more exclusively from the Turkish and Arabic
subjects of the Empire, and that the proportion of men
of Greek or Slav descent was far less, if it was not wholly
absent. When the Empire was extended over the whole of
Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Syria, the Moslem population
was enormously increased. In 1648 the corps of Janissaries
ceased to be levied from Christian youths and was
recruited from Moslems. There was wanting, therefore,
to the army the spirit given to it in the past by the Greeks
and other Christian races. This difference was probably
more serious in the case of the officers than with the rank
and file. The Turks supplied very poor material for
officers.</p>

<p>The other explanation is to be found in the absence of
incentive to military ardour in the later period. If we
have been justified in the conclusion that there was little
or no motive for the Turkish army in the shape of religious
fanaticism and the desire to spread Islam, but that plunder
and the hope of acquiring lands for distribution among
the soldiers was its main inducement, it followed that this
incentive to victory and valour was almost entirely absent
in the later period when the Empire was on the defensive,
when it was no longer a question of making fresh conquests,
but of retaining what had already been won. The army
could not expect to get loot and plunder or captives for
sale as slaves, or land to be confiscated for fiefs,
when engaged in war for the defence of some tributary or
vassal State or of some more integral part of the Empire.
Nor could there be the feeling of fighting for their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
homes and property when defending a subject Christian
province. Yet another partial explanation is to be found
in the fact that the general corruption had infected the
army, as well as the civil administration of the State.
Promotions through all the ranks went not to merit, but
to the highest bidders. The civil branches of the army
also, such as the commissariat and those for the supply of
munitions, which in the earlier period were well provided
for, fell into disorder and confusion owing to the universal
spread of corruption.</p>

<p>In view of these many serious changes, it is not difficult to
appreciate the causes for the falling off of the <i>morale</i> of
the Ottoman army and for its failure to maintain the reputation
it had achieved in the three centuries of conquest and
extension of the Empire. The war which is now raging
in the Near East has shown that the Ottoman soldiers,
when organized, and in part led, by competent foreign
officers, when fighting <i>pro aris et focis</i>, and especially
when in defence of well fortified lines, have a great military
value.</p>

<p>A third cause, however, for the failure of the Ottomans
to maintain their Empire in Europe is undoubtedly to be
found in the continually worsening conditions of the
Christian populations subject to it. In the earlier period
there is good reason to conclude that the average condition
of the rayas in the Christian provinces subjected
to Ottoman rule and law was somewhat better than that
of the peasants in some neighbouring States, such as
Hungary, Austria, and Russia. There was something in
the way of fixity of tenure accorded to the rayas which
was absent from the feudal serfs.</p>

<p>It was alleged that peasants from Hungary not infrequently
migrated into the Balkan States in order to enjoy this
better treatment, and it is certain that the Greeks of the
Morea and Crete preferred the rule of the Ottomans, bad
as it was, to that of the Venetians, who were even more cruel
and rapacious. However that may have been, it is certain
that everywhere under Turkish rule, during the last three
hundred years, the conditions of the Christian populations
became more wretched and intolerable, and relatively far
worse than in neighbouring States. This was greatly due
to the degeneracy and corruption of the central Government
at Constantinople, and to its evil example and influ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>ence
throughout the Empire. Governors of provinces and
all local officials became more corrupt and rapacious. There
was no security for life or property. Justice was not obtainable
in the local tribunals. Arbitrary exactions were levied
on the peasantry. Brigandage everywhere increased.
Money levied in the provinces was never expended for the
benefit of their populations. Turkish rule acted as a
blight on the districts subject to it. Provinces liberated
from it improved in condition beyond recognition. The
comparison with them was an ever present object-lesson
to those who remained under Turkish rule. The efforts
of the combined Powers of Europe to induce or compel
the Porte to effect improvements in the government of
its subjects proved to be futile and impotent. Treaty
obligations with this object were habitually disregarded
by the Porte and were treated as waste-paper. Provinces
thus conditioned were always on the brink of rebellion.
They were kept in subjection, not by the maintenance of
any large armed forces there, but by periodic massacres
of a ruthless character. These were not the product of
religious fanaticism, as has often been suggested, but of
deliberate policy, and were instigated by orders direct from
the Porte, with the hope of inspiring terror in the minds of
the subject races.</p>

<p>Foreign intervention, incited not so much by territorial
ambition as by popular sympathy for the oppressed, was
resorted to for the purpose of redressing grievous wrongs
and for preserving the peace of Europe. As a result of
these causes, extending over more than three hundred years,
the Turkish Empire, so far as Europe is concerned, and
in the sense of a dominant Power over subject races, has
ceased to exist. In countries which it held in subjection
for over five hundred years it has left no trace that it
ever existed. The very few Turks and the Tartars and
Circassians who had been planted there by the Porte when
the Crimea and the Caucasus were subjected by Russia
have departed bag and baggage from Europe. They have
migrated to Asia Minor at the instigation of their mollahs.
The few Moslems who remain behind in these districts are
not of Ottoman or Turkish descent; they are of the same
races as their neighbours. Their ancestors adopted Islam
to save their property.</p>

<p>The Young Turks, who of late years have controlled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Empire, have signally failed to arrest the great movement
which we have above described. They have further
developed their policy of Turkifying what remains to them
of the Empire during the existing war. Their massacres
and deportations of Armenians in Asia Minor have been on
a scale and with a cruelty without precedent in history.
Whether responsibility for this indelible crime will be enforced
on them, and whether, as it richly deserves, the
Turkish Empire will suffer further reductions, will depend
on the issue of the colossal struggle in which the nations
of Europe are now engaged. Whatever the future may
have in store in these respects, there is one certain moral
to be drawn from the story which has been told in these
pages, namely that an Empire originally founded on the
predatory instincts of an alien military caste, and whose
rulers during the last four hundred years have never recognized
that they had any responsibility for the good government
and well-being of the races subject to them, could not,
if there be any law of human progress in the world, be
permanent, and was destined ultimately to perish by the
sword.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Mr. Gibbons refuses credence to this interesting story on the ground
mainly of its inherent improbability. His argument does not convince
me. The succession of the younger brother to the Emirate without a
fight for it, on the part of the elder one, was an event so remarkable, and
so contrary to all experience in Ottoman history, as to make the explanation
given a reasonable one. The probabilities seem to me to be all in
its favour. Alaeddin died in 1337. It is admitted that for seven years he
acted as the first Grand Vizier of the Ottoman State. It may well be,
therefore, that he commenced, if he did not complete, the important
organization of the army with which he has been credited by Turkish
historians.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This was not the corps of Janissaries, which, as Mr. Gibbons has shown,

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Mr. Gibbons in his account of the origin of this corps disputes
the figures as reported above from previous writers, and also the alleged
motives for its constitution. After careful consideration of the question,
I have preferred to adhere to the version given by Sir Edwin Pears, who
has investigated the subject with great care in the early Greek and
Turkish histories. I have, however, followed Mr. Gibbons in one point,
namely, in attributing the constitution of the force to Murad I rather
than to Orchan. Mr. Gibbons’s account of the corps of Janissaries is to
be found on pp. 118-20 of the <i>Foundation of the Ottoman Empire</i>, and
that of Sir Edwin Pears in his work on the <i>Destruction of the Greek
Empire</i>, pp. 223-30.</p></div>

biographer, doubtless because Lord Stratford’s daughters were alive when
the book was published in 1888, that the Great Elchi gave testimony of
his belief in the permanence of the Turkish Empire by investing the
greater part of his personal property and savings in Turkish Bonds.
In 1874, when the Porte became bankrupt and repudiated payment of
interest on the debt, some friend at Constantinople wrote to Lord Stratford
giving timely information of what was coming and advising him to sell
his bonds while there was yet time. Lord Stratford, however, thought
it was inconsistent with his sense of honour to act on this advice. His
means were greatly reduced by the bankruptcy of the Porte. After
his death and the cessation of his pension, his daughters would have been
in very reduced circumstances if it had not been for the generosity of a
personal friend of their father, the late Lady Ossington, who made up to
these ladies, for their lives, the amount of the pension from the State
which had lapsed by the death of Lord Stratford.</p></div>

contained other severe criticisms on the rule of Abdul Hamid, was
translated into the Turkish language, for his perusal, by the late Professor
Arminius Vambéri, who was the guest of the Sultan at the time of my
visit to Constantinople in 1890, and who had suggested to him that he
should favour me with an audience. The Professor backed up my statements
by remonstrances on his own behalf, with the result that the
Sultan took grave offence. He withdrew the pension which he had
annually paid to the Professor and put an end to their long friendship.</p></div>
